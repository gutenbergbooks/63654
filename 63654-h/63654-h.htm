<h1>THE HOUSE OF ISLÂM</h1>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>In the reign of the Sultàn Abdul Mejìd Khan,
upon termination of the war with Muscovy, a multitude
of faithful Georgians and Circassians chose to
cast themselves, their women and children, upon the
bounty of the Padishah rather than endure the yoke
of an infidel conqueror. They begged but leave to
settle in some part of the Sultàn’s dominions, to
dwell in peace among true believers in obedience
to the law of God, as transmitted to Muhammed,
His Apostle. But their spokesmen had fierce eyes,
and, when a little emphasis seemed called for,
each clutched quite naturally at the dagger in his
sash.</p>

<p>The Sultàn’s advisers—black-coated, red-capped
Othmanlis of the eyes that see but never look—noted
this slight discrepancy while placidly telling their
beads. There were lawless spots in the empire. On
the confines of Esh-Shâm, for example, the peasants
paid tax to the chiefs of the desert rather than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
to the lawful tithe farmer. There was a place
with work in the world for men both loyal and warlike.</p>

<p>The Sultàn Abdul Mejìd heard those exiles. He
clothed them in the mantle of his grace. Lands
were granted in a far province, rights and privileges
were conferred upon them. Letters written under
the Tûghra made it a duty for all men to do them
honor. And to prevent untoward collision with the
old inhabitants, one Milhem Bey, a native of that
country, was appointed to overlook the settlement
and quell the disputes which were sure to arise at
the outset.</p>

<p>Many days after the Circassians had set sail for
their new land, one hot afternoon, this Milhem took
boat at Tufana, down by the bridge, and went to visit
his brother, a young doctor of the religion, who dwelt
by the shore of Asia. As his caique shot forth into
the strait, the coasts of Europe opened like a scroll.
Fat domes and slender minarets rose up white from
out dark cypress groves on the hill of Istanbûl.
Heaped Ghalata and straggling Pera gathered
beauty as their forms receded. The song of waters,
with the pleasant sense of gliding, soothed Milhem.
He closed his eyes upon the shining prospect, while
he said in his soul:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>“It is well.... Yet not altogether well.
After fifteen years of obeisance, now at last I am lord
of something—a small thing, but earnest of more to
come. That is good. Praise to Allah, I am blest in
that!... But it has taken long to reach this little
eminence, and has cost me—Merciful Allah!—how
much money! My patrimony is all but spent. And
this post is not worth the trouble unless as a step to
something finer. A few rock-scraping fellahìn, a few
wild-beast Circassians.... What profit, O Lord,
in such a government? After six months or eight I
shall return. Then, it may be, they will speak to me
of a pashalik. Where—Allah pity!—can I touch
the price of a pashalik? Without money I can go
no farther. If Shems-ud-dìn, my brother, will not
help me, I must borrow of the infidel. O Shems-ud-dìn!
O my soul! Allah knows it has been my sin to
neglect thee. How long since I embraced thee, O
my dear!”</p>

<p>The boat came to land at a point where a huddle
of colored dwellings on the sea’s brink and a mosque
with needle-pointed minarets cast a shimmer on the
smooth water. Milhem clambered out on to a landing
stage and started to climb a path through orchards
which led to his brother’s house.</p>

<p>The Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn sat under a tree enjoying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
the view, across the strait, of the imperial city,
when he was struck by the apparition of a white sunshade
slowly bobbing up the path from the shore.
Another minute and he sprang to his feet, crying,
“Thanks to Allah!” With eyes alight, he ran to
kiss his brother.</p>

<p>“They told me thou wast gone,” he said, as he
led him to the carpet under the tree. “But my heart
informed me that they lied. Thou wouldst never
have gone without my peace on thee. I am glad
they lied who told me thou wast gone.”</p>

<p>“Of a surety they lied,” chuckled Milhem.
“Everyone thought I should travel with those wild
beasts. Only this morning one of the greatest called
me laggard for remaining behind. Hear my answer!
I said: ‘O my lord, had I journeyed with the colonists,
I had surely been a party to their quarrels as
they arose. With your Grace’s permission, let the
quarrels first arise that I, coming as a stranger, may
judge impartially with whom the right. Moreover,’
I said, ‘may it please your Highness, I would set my
house in order ere I go. And your Excellency’s self
will admit that the city Istâna is mistress of more
charm than the desert possesses.’ I tell thee, he
laughed, that great one; he laughed immoderately
and praised my understanding. Men begin to perceive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
that Milhem Bey is not foolish. In sh’ Allah
he will be Milhem Pasha some day.”</p>

<p>“In sh’ Allah!” echoed Shems-ud-dìn vaguely.</p>

<p>“But a province costs much money!” sighed
Milhem, at the same time darting a sharp glance at
his brother’s face.</p>

<p>The stupid had not heard. There he sat, fingering
his great black beard, and gazing with his great
brown eyes, full and wistful as a gazelle’s, over the
cypress tops of an adjacent cemetery, over the blue
strait, to the crowding minarets of the city.</p>

<p>“Am I here to watch thee dreaming?” said Milhem
tartly. “Art in love, or what ails thee?”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn turned to him with a smile.</p>

<p>“Love, saidst thou? I have not loved these
many days, since the death of one I loved truly. She
whom I have now is but for appearance, lest neighbors
should deem me disreputable, living alone....
I do but think, O my brother! I think, by Allah’s
leave, I go with thee.”</p>

<p>Milhem flung up his hands and eyes to heaven.</p>

<p>“What a fancy!” he cried, affrighted. “May
Allah heal thee of it quickly.”</p>

<p>“Mock me not, O beloved!” pleaded Shems-ud-dìn.
“Whom love I in the world like thee? While
thou wast absent fighting in the holy wars, had my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
soul peace? And since then, seeing thee so seldom,
have I been content? I adjure thee, by our love of
old, gainsay me not in this matter!”</p>

<p>Launched upon a favorite theme, he continued
in this strain of deep affection a great while.</p>

<p>Milhem answered not a word. Profoundly
moved, he plucked up the grass near him by the roots,
snuffling to keep from tears. At last, able to bear it
no longer, he rose abruptly and took his leave with
broken words of blessing and praise to God. Not
until his boat danced midway across the path of darkening
water, and the minarets of the sovereign city,
aloft in the sunset, seemed spears of a phantom host
uplifted, threatening, did he remember his purpose
in the visit.</p>

<p>On the morrow, before noon, he found his way
to the street of sweet odors, where Shems-ud-dìn had
a shop which it was his custom to visit on that day of
each week for the purpose of taking account with his
steward. This morning Shems-ud-dìn was not alone.
Two old men sat with him in the inner gloom, beyond
where a group of women chaffered with the salesman.
They were sheykhs renowned through all the world
for their learning and piety, stern foes to innovation,
for whom a time-serving official was an unclean
beast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>Milhem bowed low before those holy ones, and
blessed the lucky day.</p>

<p>After seats had been resumed, Shems-ud-dìn
observed:</p>

<p>“I was telling these, my friends, of the journey I
purpose to make. And they have honored me with a
mission....”</p>

<p>But Milhem stopped his ears, crying: “Think
not of it, I beseech thee, O my brother! I come on
purpose to restrain thee. With the permission of
these reverend ones, thy thought to go with me is not
of wisdom. Does a man right to quarrel with the
part allotted? Behold thee here in great honor, with
such friends about thee; yet not content! Thou must
needs embark upon a venture—very perilous, very
tiresome—whereunto no one calls thee. Do not so,
O my brother, for the sin is great!”</p>

<p>“Once upon a time Eblìs himself met an angel
from Allah, and, looking earnestly upon his
face, observed, ‘Sin not, I entreat thee,’” said one
of the two old doctors in a manner of abstruse
meditation.</p>

<p>Milhem bit his lips. He said, “Who am I to
discuss what is right with the law’s exponents? Yet,
now and then, in my chamber, I give thought to these
high matters. And it has seemed, to my little understanding,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
a sin that my brother should wander from a
road so clear before him.”</p>

<p>“By my beard, I see not the harm!” said the
sheykh who had before spoken. “Why should not
our friend, the learned Shems-ud-dìn, revisit his native
land, a land of true belief? In sh’ Allah, he will
enjoy himself there.... But perhaps our lord the
Bey would go alone. Two eyes of truth fixed constantly
upon him embarrass the statesman.”</p>

<p>“Which is only to say: ‘He would keep his master’s
counsel.’ Allah witness, I have no desire save
for my brother’s welfare.”</p>

<p>“That is known for certain,” cried Shems-ud-dìn
heartily. “But fear not for me. I go gladly.”</p>

<p>Milhem shrugged his shoulders. As soon as
coffee had been served he took his departure.
Where was the use in staying longer? These dotards
showed no intention of moving, and he would not
mention his need in their cold hearing.</p>

<p>At a later hour he returned that way, and, seeing
Shems-ud-dìn alone in the depths of the shop, ran in
and, stooping, kissed the hem of his robe. Through
eagerness to convince, he magnified his want a hundredfold.
By Allah, by the admirable Korân, he
had spent all his inheritance—had sown it rather,
hoping to reap a rich crop of honor. His last para<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
had gone to procure this beggarly appointment of
governor over sundry wild beasts. On his return, if
Allah kept him alive, he would have the offer of a
wilâyet. Where in the world could he touch the
price of a wilâyet? Rather than borrow of an Armenian
or other usurious infidel, he would beg in the
gate of one of the mosques; he had not yet decided
which. He was in the hand of the Almighty, to
whom the praise.... Three hundred thousand
piasters at the lowest.... Ma sh’ Allah! It was
too much to ask of any man!...</p>

<p>“O my dear, O light of my eyes, O my breath!”
cried Shems-ud-dìn, when he could speak for amazement.
“Why hast thou kept silence? Is it for this
thou didst shun me? Fie on thy pride! Thou hast
a share in this business, as in all belonging to me.
Talk not of begging when thou hast a trade. There
is but little now in my hand; but to-morrow or the
day after I will pay thee all I can collect. Of the
rest we will speak later. Have no fear! All mine
is thine; and, by the blessing of Allah, it may be that
my patrimony has increased while thine wasted.”</p>

<p>Milhem wept on his brother’s neck and called
him kindest of the sons of Adam.</p>

<p>“By my life, he has earned the right to bear me
company,” he murmured as he went his way. “May<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Allah requite him! And if, in such close converse,
he should discover a little thing to my disadvantage,
it is so decreed. Allah knows, a man of my employments
cannot keep the habits of a saint.”</p>

<p>He vowed before God to keep strict watch upon
himself, to avoid giving offense to his brother’s piety.
But he had forgotten the vow, or recanted, when the
day of departure came.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn, with other turbaned voyagers, was
in the customhouse, patiently enduring the chicanery
of a number of small officials whose end was bakshìsh,
when Milhem passed down the middle of the great
shed, escorted by the mûdìr and a group of high officers.
He overlooked Shems-ud-dìn’s salutation, appeared
unconscious of his neighborhood. In loud
talk with his companions he walked out at the farther
doors, through which the dance of violet waves shone
twinkling, and his brother was left to conclude his
bargain with the customhouse men, when a nod from
the Sultàn’s plenipotentiary might have released him.</p>

<p>On the steamship, bewildered by the novelty of
his situation, alarmed by the pushing of rude Franks,
Shems-ud-dìn herded for countenance with a little
group of the faithful on the fore part of the deck;
nor dared to look round for Milhem. The shores
and the fair, great city were slipping fast away, ere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
he descried the latter standing amidships. He ran
to him with intent to embrace, but was checked by the
formality of his reception.</p>

<p>“Leave me alone here, I entreat thee,” said Milhem,
as if his teeth were set on edge. “Afterwards,
upon land, I will explain all things.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn withdrew, much hurt. He made
no further claim on his brother’s notice, but sat all
day long in the company of three Turkish merchants,
men of substance and of imperturbable phlegm, who
spoke in proverbs between long sucks at the narghileh.
At the rising of the night, when the evening prayer
was ended, his black servant brought him food, and
spread a bed for him beneath the stars. Once, ere
he lay down, his ear caught the voice of Milhem at
no great distance talking glibly in a foreign tongue,
and by the light of one of the lamps he could distinguish
his brother strolling amid a crowd of
Franks, both men and women. They kept laughing
the senseless, heathen laugh that knows not past
or future, nor foresees the judgment of the last
day.</p>

<p>The faces of Shems-ud-dìn’s companions were
lost in night, except when the charcoal in the bowl
of a narghileh glowed up redly as its owner drew on
it. One said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>“Allah created different animals. He made no
crossbreeds. These latter spring from sin. What
can be said of one who, being circumcised and duly
shaven like ourselves, yet chooses to sit on a chair at
a table with infidels, his hands unwashed, to eat
abomination, and to toy with unveiled women whose
face is of brass for all men, who know not shame?
Shall such an one treat us as dirt, being most likely
the son of some pimp or other? May the justice of
God overtake him, and that suddenly!”</p>

<p>“Now Allah avert that curse, for the man is my
mother’s son,” said Shems-ud-dìn sadly.</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah! Is it truth thou speakest?
Then Allah forgive me! Let it be as though I had
said nothing. I guessed not, O my lord, that he was
the son of any honorable house. Most of these officials
are the sons of nothing. Why comes he not to
sit with thee? May Allah teach him the way of the
upright!”</p>

<p>The speaker, a good old man, by name Yûsûf,
a dealer in cotton goods, sucked hard at his narghileh.
From that hour no one of the sedate circle referred
to the great man on board, or betrayed the slightest
interest in the doings of the Frankish passengers.
Time glided smoothly for Shems-ud-dìn in their company,
though few words passed, and those of abstract<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
wisdom. It seemed matter for praise to Allah that
there was no chatterer among them. And ever the
steamboat panted on over that silken sea, tossing back
its mane of dingy smoke along the furrow it had
plowed. Only when the panting ceased awhile, did
the faithful quit the pose of resignation, uncross their
legs, rise, stretch themselves, and praise God for the
view of some white town that rimmed the sea, with
minarets and distaff cypresses, and fertile gardens on
the hill beyond.</p>

<p>At length, near dawn of the fifth day, Shems-ud-dìn
awoke to find the ship at rest on the bosom of a
wide bay. Already a whiteness played upon the
ripples. Already, above high mountains in the east,
appeared a blushing streak, a fluttering pulse of light
that throbbed and spread till shapes grew clear in
silhouette upon the shore line, here a palm tree, there
a dwelling; and still the sky to seaward was night
blue and spangled with stars.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn knelt down and prayed with fervor,
prostrating himself many times. The sun rose, and
its rays struck upon his two hands held before his
face as he prayed. There were the heights of Lebanon,
towers of darkness up against a glory. By the
mercy of Allah, he beheld those heights once more.
His heart was full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>Later, when the sun rode high and many boats
had put forth from the shore, he embarked in one of
them with his friends of the voyage, and was rowed
to the customhouse. There, engaged in the civilities
preliminary to the gift of a coin, he was surprised
by Milhem. He leaped at the sound of his brother’s
voice hailing him with words of love, and the flush
of pleasure overcame him. The Bey showed a paper
to the officers, who straight made reverence. Shems-ud-dìn
and his friends were free to go where they
chose.</p>

<p>“I have saved thee and those quaint worthies a
mejidi apiece. Art thou not grateful?” laughed
Milhem, as they issued forth into the morning
sunlight.</p>

<p>Instantly their ears were assailed with the shouts
of carriage drivers, and a mob of porters pressed on
them, shouting also and gesticulating, shouldering one
another roughly in the strife for employment. The
Bey had one arm round his brother’s neck. With
the other he signaled to the most importunate of the
carriage drivers, who shook his reins in triumph; the
while he continued:</p>

<p>“Praise to Allah, that ordeal is ended. May all
the Franks rot painfully, and their fathers be consumed
with fire! But it is the will of the Sultàn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
that we mix with them and learn their ways. For
me, to hear is to obey. What am I but a servant?...
I proceed to the city Esh-Shâm by the coach
this evening. That Greek dog, my secretary, follows
with the baggage. There I obtain my soldiers from
the Wâly—a hundred only, not half enough to overawe
those wild beasts. Go thou, upon arrival in that
city, to the khan of Ahmed Effendi, the same who
was the steward of our father’s property. I shall
seek thee there.... Allah be with thee now and
always, O my beloved!”</p>

<p>He kissed Shems-ud-dìn very suddenly on both
cheeks, sprang into his carriage, and was driven to
a foreign hotel.</p>

<p>His brother, left thunderstruck, stood by the door
of the customhouse, impervious to the frantic efforts
made by porters, and others having an interest
in new arrivals, to attract his notice. He scarcely
heard his servant speak to him, and answered at
random a question as to whither they should be
going.</p>

<p>“So his Excellency the Bey has flown again,”
said the voice of Yûsûf, the old merchant, close to his
ear. “Well, Allah knows where such birds nest!
I know not, nor greatly care to know. Wilt thou
make the journey to Esh-Shâm with us who are plain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
men? With Allah’s leave we will hire baggage
animals, and buy each one of us an ass whereon to
ride. We shall journey slowly, by easy stages, being
old men and burdened with fat. If thy youth can
bear with our infirmities, journey with us and welcome,
for we love instruction, and it is seldom that
a learned sheykh of the religion falls to our lot for
company.”</p>

<p>“Let it be as he says, O my lord!” pleaded the
negro eagerly; for he tired of standing still, a gazing-stock
for low people.</p>

<p>“So be it then,” said Shems-ud-dìn, with a cordial
smile. “By my beard, I thank thee; for in this minute
I knew not where to face.”</p>

<p>So it happened that Shems-ud-dìn entered the city
of his birth one morning, riding soberly upon an ass,
in the company of three fat old men, riding each likewise
upon an ass. The legs of all four stuck out
wide over full saddlebags. On foot beside Shems-ud-dìn
went his faithful negro, now walking, now
trotting, in accordance with the donkey’s pace. From
Zebbadâni, where they had spent the night, they
ambled by garden ways to the great city, down a
valley full of shade, and the song of birds, and the
ever-sweet murmur of running waters.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn had found the journey anything but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
tiresome. And now, in the familiar streets where
every sight and sound recalled his childhood, he felt
like nothing more than a happy child.</p>

<p>Near by the khan of Ahmed Effendi, in a covered
way narrow and crowded, where the cavalcade had
to go in single file with shouts to clear the path, a
hand grasped Shems-ud-dìn’s arm, and the voice of
Milhem snarled:</p>

<p>“Get down! Get down, madman!”</p>

<p>With fear the traveler alighted, holding his donkey
by the bridle. The rope was promptly snatched
from his hand and thrust into that of the negro, who
stood grinning by.</p>

<p>“Go on—on to the khan! Destroy that beast!—hide
him!—drown him. Y’ Allah!” hissed the
same voice of authority and anger.</p>

<p>More and more alarmed, Shems-ud-dìn faced
Milhem. The latter seized his arm.</p>

<p>“Come away! This way or that, what recks it?...
And now, peradventure, thou wilt deign to inform
me why, in the Holy Name, thou masqueradest
as a jester, riding upon an ass, preceded by three old
men, all on one pattern, all of them also riding upon
asses; so that people, deeming it a portent, ask:
‘What means this strange riding?’ Thou couldst
well afford a fine horse apiece for thyself and thy servant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
What ails thee that thou must needs play the
mountebank?”</p>

<p>“I must return to my friends,” said Shems-ud-dìn,
disengaging his arm. “They will wonder what
has befallen me.”</p>

<p>“Thy friends!... That absurd procession!...
Allah witness, it is a child!—a little child!”
Milhem raised eyes to heaven, while his laugh rang
out. “Must I tell thee that thou art a great man
here? All the learned await thy visit with impatience.
They would have ridden forth to meet thee.
And behold thee seated upon the sorriest scrub of an
ass that ever I saw; preceded by three old men, all
the sons of one mother, all born at one birth, all as
like as camels. What can one say? It is a miracle,
perhaps!”</p>

<p>“They are not brothers, neither do they in aught
resemble one another,” said Shems-ud-dìn, much aggrieved.
“They are my good friends. Howbeit,
to please thee, I will sell my donkey and buy me a
good horse before we ride together.”</p>

<p>“That is well. For didst thou come riding upon
an ass, attended by three old men with but one face
between them, I should know thee for a wizard and
depart quickly.”</p>

<p>With that Milhem went off, chuckling; leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
his brother, crestfallen and mystified, to find his own
way to the khan of Ahmed Effendi.</p>

<p>Milhem’s words proved true. Shems-ud-dìn
found himself in high request among the erudite of
Damashc-esh-Shâm. During the weeks spent there,
he was constantly visiting and being visited; twice was
he called upon to preach in the great mosque; and a
general meeting of the doctors was convened on purpose
to debate with him upon certain knotty questions
of religious law. To his vast surprise, Milhem
attended him everywhere, lending a disciple’s ear to
his disquisitions, and treating him in public with a
new respect. In private, he condescended to explain:</p>

<p>“O my dear, it is well for one like me to secure
the good word of these reverend ones; who, as a rule,
hate the government and its servants. I would have
them perceive that I am not irreligious in the likeness
of other officials. And I thank Allah for thy great
holiness, O my brother!”</p>

<p>“Call me not holy!” cried Shems-ud-dìn in
horror. “There is none holy save God alone. I
give thanks for thy goodness, O light of my eyes!
Very kind hast thou been to me these last days.
Nevertheless, I shall rejoice when we ride out from
hence. It tires me, all this honor undeserved. My
head aches with the burden of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>At length came the morn when Milhem rode
forth from that city at the head of a hundred armed
horsemen. Certain of the notables of Esh-Shâm
bore him company a part of the way, and many of
the learned paid the like compliment to Shems-ud-dìn,
who cut no mean figure in the cavalcade, mounted as
he was upon a coal-black charger, richly caparisoned
with housings of gold and scarlet and light blue.
Out through the orchards they pranced in the cool
of morning, and peasants at work among the trees
stood idle a space to admire their bravery. Anon
the orchards gave place to vineyards, the vineyards
in turn fell away, and the desert rolled out before
them, smooth and bare. Then, a halt being called,
the promenaders from the city took leave of the serious
wayfarers.</p>

<p>“It is the pilgrim’s road. You face the kibleh!”
one called to Shems-ud-dìn. “Allah hold you in safe
keeping!”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn rode beside Milhem at the head of
his retinue. Their way led straight across the brown
waste—a track a mile wide marked by the horde of
pilgrims wending yearly to Mekka. Here and there,
upon the sky line, rose a wave of faint blue mountain.
The sun shone hot on their left cheeks.</p>

<p>Milhem was in high spirits. Ever and anon he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
turned in the saddle to gaze with pride upon his suite,
who rode at ease, smoking cigarettes, talking and
laughing lightly together.</p>

<p>“Art thou happy?” asked Shems-ud-dìn.</p>

<p>“Very happy. Praise be to Allah who has freed
my hand at last. I have not known such elation
since the day when the Muscovites fled from before
Silistria.”</p>

<p>“Silistria! Wast thou really there? I have not
heard thee speak of it. The story, I beseech thee.”</p>

<p>“I speak but of the joy felt by all believers when
the place was relieved. I was not of the heroes.”</p>

<p>“But thou thyself hast done brave deeds, O my
brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, surely,” said Milhem; and he proceeded to
recount a few of them.</p>

<p>That night, in a pavilion pitched on the open
plain, the guards lying upon the ground without,
around their watch fires, Shems-ud-dìn could not sleep
for the wonder of those tales. Himself a timid man,
he loved to hear of wild encounters. He strove to
place himself in some of the perils braved by Milhem,
and thought he would have died of fright.</p>

<p>There seemed no end to Milhem’s strange adventures.
On the morrow he remembered more of
them, which he told with a wealth of homely circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
which enabled Shems-ud-dìn to witness all he
heard. For the listener, those long marches passed
as the Thousand and One Nights must have passed
for King Shahriar.</p>

<p>They left the plain and entered a land of rocks,
where the horses picked their own way gingerly.
Here progress was, perforce, much slower. At
length, after noon of the fourth day, he reached a
height whence, their guide informed them, they could
catch sight of their destination. Immediately a dispute
arose among the soldiery, some vowing they
could see a fine city plainly, while others as positively
asserted that there was nothing of the sort within
view. Milhem made use of his field glass, a marvel
he loved to display, then handed it to his brother.
At first Shems-ud-dìn could see nothing; but suddenly
he became aware of rocks, and houses like to rocks,
of monstrous ruins and a few poor fig trees, the whole
presented in a rainbow light not of earth.</p>

<p>“A sweet, a charming place!” said Milhem
bitterly.</p>

<p>They descended a rough slope to a ravine, which
led on to other ravines; so that more than three hours
elapsed ere they again beheld the little town, this
time close at hand. A motley crowd of men occupied
a hillock at the entering in of the place, above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
the thrashing floors. At sight of the horsemen this
crowd broke in a trice and ran helter-skelter down
the hill to meet them. There appeared some strife
among the runners, each trying by every means to retard
a neighbor. Some were knocked down; some
rolled together, struggling among the rocks.</p>

<p>“Allah have mercy! Behold, trouble already!
A feud, if I mistake not,” said Milhem, as he watched
the race. He spoke a word to the chief of the soldiers,
who repeated it in a louder tone. The troop
pulled up, smartly, on the alert.</p>

<p>Two young men, an Arab and a Circassian, had
distanced all competitors. They ran beyond reach
of one another, converging upon the spot where
the Governor had halted. As they drew near, it
seemed the Circassian had a slight advantage, but so
slight that they were about to collide, when the Arab
caught his rival’s trousers to fling him back. The
other turned with a yell, felled his adversary, and
knelt upon his belly. A knife flashed on high. It
would have fallen had not some one caught the arm
that flourished it. There was a moment’s tussle.
The Circassian turned to face his new assailant, when
all at once his resistance died away. With a curt
laugh he dropped his blade.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he said to the soldiers, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
now surrounded him. “I would have eaten that
dog and all of you into the bargain. Not yours the
victory. It belongs to that man there. I looked in
his eyes while we fought, and they disarmed me; there
was no wrath in them.”</p>

<p>“Capital! Most marvelous!” cried Milhem.
Forgetting dignity in his excitement, he sprang down
off his horse and embraced the hero of the hour.
“Thou, the timid one, to perform such a deed!
Even I, who am called courageous, had hesitated to
come between that wild beast and his prey.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn was near weeping. He could not
believe that it was indeed he who had shown such
presence of mind. He felt weak now, and dizzy, incapable
of any action whatsoever.</p>

<p>By this time the crowd of townsmen had come up.
Alarmed by what had happened, they stood silent
by until the Bey remounted, when another rush befell,
another struggle. “A boon, O our lord!”—“A
boon!”—“Hear him!”—“Hear him not!”
came the conflicting shouts. There seemed every
prospect of a bloody fight under the very nose of the
Sultàn’s appointed peacemaker.</p>

<p>At a word from Milhem, the soldiers surrounded
both factions.</p>

<p>“Where is the sheykh of the place?” shouted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
great man furiously. A tall old man stepped forward,
making reverence. “Where the chief of the
colonists?”</p>

<p>“I am he!” bawled the prisoner insolently, from
between the troopers guarding him. “My name is
Hassan Agha, and the title Guardian of the Frontier
was conferred upon me by express firmàn.”</p>

<p>Milhem smiled. “Release his Excellency at
once. Allah forgive the indignity offered to one so
great and powerful. By the Korân, I took thee for a
common murderer. Deign to come a little nearer!
I would get down off my horse and offer him to your
Highness were I less weary with traveling.”</p>

<p>The man approached, shamefaced, while a titter
spread among the crowd.</p>

<p>“Stand on my right hand, O Great Guardian of
the Frontier, and thou, O sheykh, on my left....
Praise be to God!” he cried suddenly. “His Grace,
Hassan Agha, Guardian of the Frontier, deigns to
stand beside my horse. O honor!”</p>

<p>A roar of laughter went up from crowd and
soldiery.</p>

<p>“Show a little mercy, O my lord!” whispered
Hassan wretchedly. “Am I not shamed enough?”</p>

<p>Milhem did not answer. With the heads of both
factions as it were at his saddlebow, he made haste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
to inform himself of the grounds of dispute between
them. On the one hand, he learned how the Circassians
would pay for nothing, how they were a turbulent
crew, the worst of neighbors, and had even
shown disrespect to some women belonging to the old
inhabitants; on the other hand, how the Arabs were
a set of churls, fathers of avarice, without one generous
thought in their black hearts. Shems-ud-dìn,
hearing the vigor of those mutual denunciations,
judged the case hopeless of settlement without
bloodshed. He was amazed to hear Milhem
chuckle.</p>

<p>“It is my intention, and the will of the Sultàn is
with me in the matter,” said the Governor pleasantly,
“to live throughout my stay here at the expense of
the lord of this place, be he Circassian or the son of
an Arab; to reward his loyalty, and that he may boast
to his children’s children of how he entertained the
Viceroy. Now unto the house of which of you two
shall I repair?”</p>

<p>The rivals stooped down and exchanged glances
under the horse’s belly.</p>

<p>“He is the sheykh of the town,” said Hassan.
“And I have no house of my own.”</p>

<p>“He is the Guardian of the Frontier,” said the
sheykh. “And may it please your Excellency, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
has taken my best house and is living in it without
rent. A sin it is, and a great loss to me.”</p>

<p>“Your honor does not mean to ruin either of
us?” coaxed Hassan, glancing up at the great man’s
face.</p>

<p>“In sh’ Allah, he does but jest,” muttered the
sheykh, with fervor.</p>

<p>“I have the power,” said Milhem sternly, “and
by Allah Most High, I will quarter myself and all
my retinue upon that one of you who first breaks the
peace. To-night my camp is pitched beyond the
town. You have heard my judgment. Go!”</p>

<p>The old Arab and the young Circassian fell back
together, grinning at that clever judgment. But
presently the latter returned, and clutched Shems-ud-dìn’s
stirrup.</p>

<p>“As for thee,” he cried, “thou shalt lodge nowhere
but in my house. I swear it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go with him, O my brother,” said Milhem,
as one well pleased. “It seems thou art a
tamer of wild beasts. Go with him and Allah with
thee.”</p>

<p>So it happened that Shems-ud-dìn and his servant
supped and slept that night in the house of a wild
brigand, whose talk reeked of gore. And when he
awoke in the morning, there was Hassan watching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
him from the arched doorway, where he stood polishing
a long-barreled gun with a piece of goatskin.
They smiled the one to the other.</p>

<p>“Watching thee asleep, I have found out why
thou didst overcome me yesterday—me, the pupil of
the mighty Shamil; thou, a peaceful doctor of religion.
It is because thou art a saint!” said Hassan
Agha.</p>

<p>“Allah witness I am the least saintlike of men,”
said Shems-ud-dìn, yawning to fuller consciousness.
But Hassan would have it that he was a saint.</p>

<p>“I go presently to see thy brother,” he added
after awhile. “We need horses if we are to fight the
Bedû. He is a devil, that brother of thine. I expect
he will help us with some stratagem.... By
Allah, it is a thankless task, protecting these tillers
of the rock. They have been wont to pay to the
chiefs of the desert a tribute, by virtue of which they
were unmolested. Now they scowl on us because we
forbid all tribute save to the officers of our lord the
Padishah—that is, ourselves. As yet we have not
seen one Bedawi. The whole nation, they say, is far
away in the east at this season. They come not here
before the first rain. But these fellahìn are great
liars. They told us there was a forest close at hand,
but when we looked, behold! a few old terebinths<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
scattered over as many hills. They told me there
were tigers, but after hunting the region near and
far, I brought back but one lean partridge, some
conies, some pigeons, and an owl or so. There are
no tigers. Perhaps there are no Bedû either.”</p>

<p>Hassan spoke in a jargon approaching Turkish
interspersed with words of Arabic. Shems-ud-dìn
understood what was said, though he would have
been puzzled to separate the words. The friendliness
of the speaker was, at all events, past question.
He clapped his hands and a girl appeared from some
inner chamber, bearing a tray, whereon was bread
and curds and fruit, which the negro took from her
and set before his master.</p>

<p>“It is my woman,” said Hassan casually.
“Thou hast not brought one with thee? A pity!
Thou wilt sigh in vain. Now there is the daughter
of my uncle—he who commands the colonists at Ain
Tûbeh, six hours from here—a fine girl, plump and
tractable. My uncle would resign her to thee at a
fair price—that is, if he have not already struck a
bargain with the dealer. It is a custom from of old
with us to sell the pretty ones. So they become the
mothers of great men, perchance even of the Sultàn’s
majesty.”</p>

<p>“I have not given thought to woman these many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
days,” said Shems-ud-dìn, with the look of sad remembrance.
“My fair one, my Leylah, died in
childbed awhile since, my desire with her. A long
story, O my friend! It began at Edreyneh, whither
I had gone, by invitation of my friend, the learned
Mustafa, to preach throughout Ramadan in the
mosque of Sultàn Selìm——”</p>

<p>“By thy leave,” broke in Hassan, “the morning
calls us. At noon or in the evening we can tell our
stories. Come forth now, and let me show thee this
place of dogs.”</p>

<p>No sooner did they leave the house, than men
emerged from adjacent dwellings and walked with
them till, ere they had traversed half the town, they
headed a multitude. Hassan led the way by foul
and narrow alleys to the open hill where stood the
remains of great buildings, whose smooth pillars and
finely wrought capitals contrasted the rudeness of the
modern stonework.</p>

<p>“These are the work of the jinn,” said a voice
from the crowd. “The devils still hold festival
here of nights when there is no moon.”</p>

<p>Here in the arena of a ruined amphitheater Milhem’s
tent was pitched. Around it half-dressed soldiers
were grooming their horses to the entertainment
of a swarm of noisy children. Hassan went forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
to the tent; Shems-ud-dìn, in enjoyment of the morning
sun, sat down upon a fallen column with his face
to the blaze.</p>

<p>The flat mud roofs of the town formed a succession
of terrace steps beneath him, descending to a
stony wady, beyond which swelled the wilderness of
barren rocks. A patch of verdure by the town spring,
a few olive trees down in the ravine, a few poor fig
trees among the ruins near to where he sat—all else
was bronze and purple of the desert hills.</p>

<p>“Even such a land,” he mused aloud, “did our
lord Muhammed (peace to him) inhabit of old.
Amid such solitudes did the angel of God converse
with him to the salvation of man and jinni.”</p>

<p>The townsfolk had taken seat around him upon
the ruins. All eyes were fixed on his face. At those
pious words one said: “It is some holy one!” and
the whisper ran apace. It startled Shems-ud-dìn,
who had forgotten their existence, when the sheykh
of the place stood forth and bowed before him,
saying:</p>

<p>“Instruct us, O master! We believe; but ignorantly,
having but little knowledge of the Way.
Teach us now, we entreat thee.”</p>

<p>Then Shems-ud-dìn, looking round upon those
eager faces, was moved to pity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>“You can recite the Fat’ha and the belief?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Instantly the prayer went up as from one throat,
and the shout followed:</p>

<p>“God is greatest. There is no God but God;
and Muhammed is the Apostle of God.”</p>

<p>“You are not in total darkness,” said Shems-ud-dìn,
with a smile; and he began to tell them of the
dealings of God with men from the days of Adam
and Nûh and Ibrahìm unto the time of Muhammed,
and thence downward even to the present day.</p>

<p>In this occupation, Milhem, coming forth from
council with the chief of the colonists, found him at
length.</p>

<p>“Hail, O tamer of wild beasts!” he laughed.
“It is as if they would swallow thee whole, their
mouths are so wide open. It is too hot for thee to
sit out longer. Come now into my tent—or return
to the house of our friend, the Guardian of the Frontier.
By Allah, I must thank thee for his friendship.
It is a great debt I owe thee, for he could have done
me endless mischief.”</p>

<p>“By my gun, he is a devil, that brother of
thine!” said Hassan, as they sauntered back through
the town. “With one blink of his eyes he constructed
a plan whereby we may obtain a stud of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
best horses at the lowest price ever known. But that
is a secret.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn lacked curiosity. He was thinking
how to improve the minds of those Muslims, so hungry
for instruction.</p>

<p>In the days which followed, he delivered many
discourses in the little tumble-down mosque, and up
on the open hillside. He came to love the place and
its inhabitants, and could not sympathize with Milhem,
whose lips dropped curses on the entire country.</p>

<p>Summer broke at length, with thunder, lightning,
and a tremendous downpour. Rain fell in sheets for
the space of five days. When at last the sky cleared,
there was a new cold taste in the air; a torrent thundered
in the gorge beneath the town; green plants
began to shoot among the rocks. In a little while
the hill of ruins became starred all over with blossoms
of the crocus and the cyclamen.</p>

<p>Then Hassan was absent all day long, scouring
the hills with his men, armed to the teeth. Each
evening he spent in cleaning and polishing his beloved
weapons.</p>

<p>One night he came in with eyes of joy.</p>

<p>“The Bedû, O beloved! I have seen the Bedû!
Their tents blacken a dell not two hours distant.
Their herds roam at large. They will come hither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
for the accustomed tribute. Ah, thy brother is a
devil! To-morrow and, it may be, the next day also,
I abide in the house with thee. Dost wonder why?
Ah, that is a secret!”</p>

<p>Two days later, as Shems-ud-dìn sat meditating
beneath a fig tree on the hill of ruins, shrouded horsemen
came riding out of the east. His eyes made out
twenty of them, each armed with a long lance whose
point glanced in the sunlight, each well mounted on
a prancing steed. Then, remembering the veiled
words of Hassan relative to the tribute, he descended
in haste to the town.</p>

<p>Standing at the junction of two narrow ways, he
saw the foremost of the cavaliers ride up to the
sheykh’s door, before which a few children seemed to
loiter. The sheykh came forth, crying welcome, and
offering his house by a gesture. The leader jumped
down and made fast his horse to a stone of the wall.
His followers also alighted, tethering their steeds
in like manner. They all entered the house with
friendly words to its owner.</p>

<p>No sooner were they gone than from every dwelling
beside the way, out of every lane, poured soldiers
and armed Circassians. The throng prevented
Shems-ud-dìn from seeing what happened after. But
a fearful din arose; shrieks, curses, laughter mingled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
with the clash of arms. He stopped his ears. The
sky above the hovels turned black in his sight, the
houses livid white, a grin beneath frowning brows.</p>

<p>Presently, one came running blindly, moaning
as he ran—a man well stricken in years, no other
than the sheykh himself. A tall, slim girl ran after
him, barefoot and weeping, her veil displaced.
Shems-ud-dìn caught the old man’s hand and ran
with him till the town was left behind. There the
frenzied wretch broke from him, and flung himself
down in a place of stones, dashing his face upon hard
rocks, cursing the day that he was born. Shems-ud-dìn
and the girl raised him up between them, and in
so doing their eyes met. She bethought her of her
veil; in haste she dragged the white lawn across her
face, while the little pout of annoyance in self-consciousness
became her well. It seemed to Shems-ud-dìn
that he had gazed once more in Leylah’s eyes—profound
as a night of stars when no moon rises.</p>

<p>Despite all attempts to calm him, the sheykh went
on shrieking and tearing his raiment. He plucked
off his turban and adherent tarbûsh, and cast them
from him, exposing his naked poll to the sun of noon.</p>

<p>“Allah witness, I was forced to it!” he yelled
madly. “The sons of Eblìs forced me to betray my
good lords. They sat as guests in my house when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the soldiers took them. Their horses are stolen, they
themselves taken to serve in the army. O Lord!...
Allah knows the deceit was forced on me.
Hassan—may his father perish!—swore to slay my
three sons if I refused. We had peace till he came.
Now we shall never know peace any more. For our
lords of the desert will avenge this outrage. The
Circassian pigs will not suffer, for they have no property.
But we ... O Lord! Would to God I were
dead and in the tomb!”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn replaced the skullcap and turban
upon the old man’s head. When the frenzy had
somewhat abated, he advised him to seek some neighbor’s
house; and watched him shuffle off, leaning upon
the arm of the tall maid who hid Leylah’s eyes beneath
her veil, and had not said farewell. Then he
himself strode frowning in search of Milhem.</p>

<p>His Excellency sat in the guest chamber of the
sheykh’s house, flushed with triumph, the Circassians
praising God around him. He was in the course of
dictating a report of the affair to the Greek, his secretary,
when Shems-ud-dìn stood in the midst and
cried shame on him. For one minute he seemed
startled. The next he turned his eyes toward the
vaulted roof, crying:</p>

<p>“Allah witness, it is a child—a little child!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“Now I know why thou wast loath to have me
journey with thee. And I confess here, before all
these men, that I did wrong not to be ruled by thee
then, that I did wrong in cleaving to thee. For
great grief is come upon me. My brother, once the
best of men, has sinned most heinously, and I am
witness of his crime.”</p>

<p>“Said I not he was a saint?” said Hassan triumphantly,
from somewhere in the background.</p>

<p>Milhem frowned, stroking his close beard, then
smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>“What dost thou know of statecraft? Go, O
my brother! and when thou art recovered I will speak
with thee,” he said, with some compassion and much
dignity.</p>

<p>“I go,” said Shems-ud-dìn curtly, and stepped
forth once more into the sunlight.</p>

<p>That night, as he sat with Hassan in the house,
the latter mocked at his grave looks.</p>

<p>“Art still vexed about thy brother’s little stratagem?
Let not that trouble thee. It is war, thou
understandest. The Bedû will take vengeance for
this, and we, in turn, shall avenge their vengeance,
and so it will go on—in sh’ Allah—till the
last day.”</p>

<p>“My thought is not of war,” said Shems-ud-dìn.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
“Know, O Hassan, that I love once more!” And
he related his adventure with the old sheykh’s daughter.
“O her eyes! O her straight white nose! O
the fullness of her cheeks, her chin!... Now tell
me, what character does she bear?”</p>

<p>“Thou wouldst not wed her, surely?”</p>

<p>“I love—that is enough. My life flows out to
her. There is but one beloved!”</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah!” murmured Hassan, in the utmost
consternation. “She is a girl like another.
There is nothing told of her. A virgin has no form,
no color, no fire, save that one gives to her. For me
she is nothing; for thee, much. As for character,
she has none, which means she is a young girl....
But reflect, O my dear! When thou returnest to
Istanbûl——”</p>

<p>“I shall not return.”</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah!” muttered Hassan again, and
he kept silence a great while, munching his long mustache.
At length he said, “I must inform thy
brother, my lord the Bey, of this thy decision.”</p>

<p>“Tell him,” said Shems-ud-dìn.</p>

<p>On the morrow he was roused betimes by Hassan’s
hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Arise, O my soul, and come with me to my lord
the Bey. I have seen him already.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>It was a gray dawn threatening rain. In silence
they repaired to the house which Milhem had occupied
since the approach of winter. The great man
sat upon his bed to receive them.</p>

<p>“O Shems-ud-dìn, what is this?” he cried reproachfully.
“Is it true thou wilt abide in this wilderness
worse than Jehennûm? Surely thou art
mad. There, at Istanbûl, thou art in the road to
great honor. By Allah, I look to see thee Sheykh-ul-Islâm.
Whereas here—what awaits thee?...
And canst thou contemplate a lasting union with the
daughter of a base fellâh—thou who couldst make a
grand alliance to enhance thy honor and mine? I
beseech thee, think not of it! If thou doest this
through disgust of what befell here yesterday, know
that those men are rebels against the Sultàn. They
owe more than the worth of their horses to the government.
And how light their punishment! They
are but asked to serve three years in the army, like
every faithful subject of his Majesty. By Allah,
there is no wrong done to them!... Say, was that
the reason of thy mad resolve?... The term of
my appointment draws nigh, and it makes me sad
to think of leaving thee here in this lair of wild
beasts.”</p>

<p>“I am content to be here,” said Shems-ud-dìn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
firmly. “Once have I sinned in forsaking the path
God showed me. I will not sin that sin a second
time.”</p>

<p>“But Allah pity! What can a man of thy
wealth and attainments do in a place like this? It is
not a place one could beautify for a wonder and a
byword. I myself have had that dream: to change
a desert to a paradise. But what can a man like thee
do here?”</p>

<p>“He can live in peace; he can teach the people;
he can ply his trade in the bazaar. As for my wealth,
I have no need for all of it. When thou regainest
Istanbûl, sell all I possess, and take the half of the
proceeds to thyself, sending me the other half. I
shall give thee letters to my steward and also to the
heads of the learned. Thy need is greater than
mine.”</p>

<p>“Allah, look! It is a child—a foolish child!”
cried Milhem loudly; but he was somewhat moved
from opposition to his brother’s scheme. “Thou
talkest of peace. Remember yesterday. That is
nothing—a trifle—a mere beginning.... Peace
forsooth! Nay, my soul fears grave danger for
thee.”</p>

<p>“Fear not, O my lord!” said Hassan, who had
all this while stood silent by. “On my head be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
danger. This, my good lord, thy brother, is not one
who can guard himself. He is not like thee, a devil!
Thou hast said it: he is a child—a little child,
whose hand is in the hand of Allah. The friendship
of such an one is counted to a man for righteousness.
By Allah, I am glad he stays with us. His presence
calls a blessing on us all. But would to Allah he had
chosen the daughter of my uncle. It would not have
been half so serious. As it is, we must swear peace
with those fellahìn forever and ever.”</p>

<p>“Said I not well when I named thee tamer of
wild beasts?” said Milhem laughing. “But I
would thou hadst chosen some pleasanter way in
which to display thy power. I ask but one thing of
thee, thou dear madman. Let me depart ere thy
wedding. I would not defer thy bliss, but fix it for
the day of my departure; so thou shalt not mourn
my loss too deeply. I shall start at the dawn, leaving
my peace with thee. By Allah, it is a disgrace
to our house. Nevertheless, do as thou wilt. It is
thy business.”</p>

<p>The day whereon Milhem’s government expired,
Shems-ud-dìn rose two hours before daylight,
mounted the horse which Hassan had saddled for
him, and rode slowly to his brother’s residence. The
town was astir. Lights moved here and there as yellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
eyes in the darkness, illuming spaces of rough
wall and filthy pathway. He had to shout his way
through the crowd which choked the approaches to
the house of the Bey.</p>

<p>The cavalcade stood ready to start, bits jangled,
stallions neighed. The soldiers standing at their
horses’ heads, in hooded ulsters and high, long-tasseled
fezzes, cut a queer figure as seen in silhouette
against the shine of sundry lanterns borne by members
of the crowd.</p>

<p>At the noise of his brother’s arrival, Milhem came
out, when the crowd gave forth a strange, deep note,
like a night bird’s cry, repeated at regular intervals;
and with the note each man beat his staff with might
upon the ground. The staves fell as one. The
effect was both weird and mournful, by the light of
a few scattered lanterns, in that cold hour and in the
darkness under the stars.</p>

<p>Milhem was warmly wrapped. He embraced
his brother silently, and then in a husky voice gave
the word to advance.</p>

<p>The same wild sounds of respect and woe accompanied
them to the hill without the town, to ring in
their ears long after.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn rode beside his brother through
dark chasms of the hills till the white of dawn appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
above the rock ridge toothed like a saw.
Then he reined in his horse.</p>

<p>“In thy grace I depart,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“With my peace thou goest!” said Milhem, and
he gulped as if to swallow something which impeded
speech. “Allah knows I sin in suffering thee to
remain here alone. My heart reproves mere sorely.
Kindest of the kind hast thou been to me always.
Often have I been ungrateful; very often have I
sinned against thee. I ask thy forgiveness humbly
now. Allah knows my soul hurts me!... O beloved!...
Give me now a blessing ere we part.”</p>

<p>Milhem sprang down off his horse, and would
have knelt to Shems-ud-dìn had not the latter, dismounting
also, prevented him, saying:</p>

<p>“Thus only do I bless thee, O my dear!” He
kissed Milhem warmly on both cheeks.</p>

<p>For a moment they clung together, white dawn
on their faces. Then Shems-ud-dìn whispered:</p>

<p>“God bless thee, O my brother, now, and in the
hour of death, and in the last day.”</p>

<p>He climbed back into the saddle and rode lonely
away, followed by shouts of good will from all the
escort. He felt nothing, saw nothing, thought of
nothing, for a long while.</p>

<p>Just as he reached that turn of the wady whence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
the town is first seen, the sun glanced out behind him.
Himself in deep shadow, he beheld all the opposite
slope, dwarf town, giant ruins, a few poor fruit
trees, bathed of a sudden in a rich glow, like nothing
earthly, beneath a sky grape blue and full of stars.
He drew rein, gaping at the vision. There were the
peasants going to their tillage among the rocks; there
were the veiled ones tripping down to the spring,
each with arms upcurved to sustain the pitcher upon
her head. In that ruddy glow they flitted as thin
shades. He could realize nothing, remember nothing.
The place seemed foreign to him.</p>

<p>But presently a horseman galloped forth from the
town, and rode straight toward him, clattering upon
the rocks. Shems-ud-dìn heard his shout. It was
the voice of Hassan, crying:</p>

<p>“Hail to the bridegroom!”</p>

<p>Then Shems-ud-dìn blushed hot for joy. Even
now the bride prepared herself. It was his wedding
morn.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>

</div>

<p>Many years had passed since that day-spring.
Shems-ud-dìn sat in his shop in the small bazaar, a
great sorrow at his heart. His wife had died long
ago; his son, lured by promises from the exalted Milhem,
had gone forth to try his fortune in the government
service; and now it had pleased God to smite
the last remaining of his dear ones.</p>

<p>Alia, little Alia, whom he cherished as his own
eyes, lay sick of a wasting illness none could name.
Every homely charm and nostrum had been applied
in vain. A famous leech from distant Damashc-esh-Shâm
had bled her copiously, and stayed ten days in
the house, expecting some good result. At last, seeing
her life still waned, he had taken Shems-ud-dìn
aside and spoken gravely.</p>

<p>“O Sheykh, this is from the hand of Allah. All
my science is as air against it. The stalk is cut, the
ear will fall. It is decreed. Grieve not overmuch,
I entreat thee. Rather thank Allah that it is not
thy son, but only a girl from whom no honor comes.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn duly thanked Allah, but cast about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
in his mind for some remedy yet to try. He was
come to his shop at this idle hour of noon on purpose
to think undisturbed. But the halls of his understanding
were darkened and unfamiliar; even the
lamp of faith burned dimly, a great way off. Though
he prayed, “In mercy heal her! O Allah, spare the
sunshine of my age!” he knew the worthlessness of
such prayer. His will was not lost in the Divine
Will, but beat against it to its own hurt, a moth at
the flame.</p>

<p>The voice of the torrent in the wady, swollen
from days of rain, droned in his ears. The noontide
murmur of the town—men’s talk, the cooing of
doves, a clink from the forge—was subdued by it.
It filled all the pauses of thought with a dull refrain
which seemed that of his own woe, the ever-recurring
numbness of sheer grief that prevented his thinking
to any purpose. It deadened a noise of bells approaching,
until it was quite near, in the bazaar itself.</p>

<p>The clangor filled the air suddenly, starting
many echoes. But Shems-ud-dìn did not turn his
head. He continued sitting with his back to the
world, spreading out his hands over the brazier,
which he had lighted for an illusion of comfort. He
heard the ponderous, padded tread of camels; he
smelt their hides; and one by one, in passing, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
huge beasts took the daylight from him. The jangle
of the bells was deafening.</p>

<p>All at once it ceased. The train had halted.
But Shems-ud-dìn did not turn his head.</p>

<p>“O Allah, weld my will to Thine! O Lord,
spare my daughter!” he kept moaning.</p>

<p>“For how much dost thou sell this, O effendi?”
said a husky voice behind him.</p>

<p>Turning then, in some dismay, Shems-ud-dìn beheld
a man unkempt and meanly clad, grinning sheepishly
as he held up a tiny bottle of attar of roses. It
was evidently one of the camel drivers, for he held
the end of a rope wound round his wrist; and the
small, superb face of a camel looked over his head
into the shop, sneering at what it saw there.</p>

<p>“For how much?” came again in the husky
voice. “I give thee six piasters.”</p>

<p>“Be it thine at that price. Take it, my son, and
go in peace.”</p>

<p>The grin departed from the camel driver’s face.
His mouth fell open, and his eyes grew round with
alarm. He set down the bottle hastily, and began
muttering to himself.</p>

<p>“What ails thee? Why dost thou murmur in
thy soul?” asked Shems-ud-dìn.</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah! Thou askest why? Is there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
not cause enough, O my master? Is this precious
attar—the soul of a thousand roses? By Allah, no,
I think not. For six piasters! And if I bought it
and carried it to her I love, and a jinni came out and
deflowered her I love, and slew me and took my love
away under the sea or among the roots of the mountains....
Aha, precious attar indeed! and cheap at
six piasters!... But Ibrahìm is a wary man, one
accustomed to look behind him. When he saw thy
back toward him, when thou gavest him no greeting,
he said in his soul, ‘O soul, be warned! Either this
merchant will play the listless to drive the harder
bargain, or else here is something strange, out of the
natural——’”</p>

<p>“Be silent, foolish one!” interrupted Shems-ud-dìn.
“My daughter, in whom I delight, lies near
to death, and my mind is distraught with grief.
Though I heard thee and saw, it conveyed nothing to
my mind. In truth, the perfume is worth more than
six piasters. Take it as a gift from me and go.”</p>

<p>At that the simpleton kissed the ground before
Shems-ud-dìn.</p>

<p>“O father of mercy!” he blubbered. “Long
have I desired to make such a present to her I love.
Allah comfort thee, O my dear lord! Despair not
for thy girl. There be workers of miracles in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
land nowadays. Hear what befell myself awhile
since. As I journeyed to the Holy City in the train
of certain Franks, having charge of their baggage,
death seized me round my belly and flung me from my
mule whereon I sat, and laid me upon the stones of
the path, and there knelt on me with such weight
that I shrieked aloud for the pain in my midst. It
had been the end of me, had not one of the infidels,
who was a physician, jumped down off his horse, and
producing something from his clothes, forced me to
swallow a part of it. Its taste was bitter as gall, so
that I screamed the more and cursed the poisoner.
But after a little, death fled and my health returned
to me, and I went forward singing upon my way.
Great is the science of the Franks. Our physicians
are as fools to them. They have a fine hospital in
El Cûds. Take thy daughter thither....”</p>

<p>“Ya I-bra-hìm!” came a cry out of the distance.
“Where art thou? Make haste! We tire of waiting.”</p>

<p>“The companions call me. In thy grace, I go.
Forget not my counsel. What is the journey to El
Cûds for one like thee? Three days, or four at the
most; and the girl can ride comfortably in a palanquin
between two mules. There, with Allah’s leave,
she will be healed.... I come! I come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>Tucking the bottle into his waistband, he turned
and would have run, had not the camel, refusing to
be hurried, pulled him up with a jerk. The rope
between them was taut as a lute string as they passed
from sight.</p>

<p>The jangle of bells had sunk once more beneath
the roar of the torrent ere Shems-ud-dìn perceived
that his prayer was answered. Then great awe fell
upon him, and he said in his heart, “I have sinned.”
It shamed him to know that Allah had heard his
wayward moaning. He, an old man whose beard
was white, had prayed blindly, senselessly, as a child
prays, to be shown a little hope, some remedy yet
untried. Now that his request was granted, he felt
as that camel driver had felt on finding the attar his
at the price first offered.</p>

<p>While he sat thus between great hope and fear,
a face looked in upon him out of the sunlight, and a
youthful voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>“May thy day be happy, O my master. How
fares the beloved?”</p>

<p>It was Shibli, his favorite pupil and the bridegroom
designate of Alia.</p>

<p>“Enter, O my son, and welcome,” said Shems-ud-dìn;
and he straight described to his disciple all the
happenings since sunrise, from the departure of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
city physician to the advice so strangely proffered by
a simple camel driver. At the end, Shibli cried:</p>

<p>“It is the best advice. Let us go to El Cûds.
Apart from the virtue of a pilgrimage to the Dome
of the Rock, I thirst to behold so famous a city. My
father will grant me leave to travel with thee. O
happy day!”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn smiled upon the boy’s excitement.
To rebuke it, he said:</p>

<p>“Allah knows it is not for pastime that I go.”</p>

<p>But Shibli’s delight in the prospect made it bright
for him also.</p>

<p>Presently, giving his disciple charge of the shop,
Shems-ud-dìn issued forth into the sunlight and
started to climb a steep and stony path, like the bed
of a torrent, which led to his dwelling. Women,
gossiping at their doors, blessed him by name as he
passed, and inquired tenderly concerning the health
of his dear one. The sun, sinking down upon the
hilltop, dazzled his eyes. Hope, renewed, opened the
gates of his mind, even as his despondency had shut
them fast, to things around him. He noticed the
lizard basking in the sunshine, the tuft of hyssop
growing between the stones.</p>

<p>His house stood highest of all in the little city,
close upon the hill of ruins. He had himself planned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
and superintended its building long ago, so that there
was none like it for size and nobility of aspect.</p>

<p>Before the wide open arch which was the entrance
hall, upon a terrace of rolled mud—which
seemed a parade ground, but was in fact but the roof
of the house below—an old negro was standing in a
posture of some dejection, gazing wistfully at the
heights beyond the wady. He started at his master’s
approach, and answered the question about Alia with
a despairing grin.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn passed into the house. Very softly
he opened a door. The room within was darkened.
What light stole in through chinks in the shutters revealed
but vague outlines.</p>

<p>“How is she?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“As always. She has not slept.” Some one
arose in the gloom and came to him.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” wailed a fretful voice from the
floor. “O Fatmeh, who is it? Bid him depart.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn went and knelt beside the sufferer.</p>

<p>“See, O beloved! I have brought thee a
thing thou lovest well—some of thy chosen perfume!”</p>

<p>“I love it not. I hate it! I hate everything!
O Allah, kill me quickly!... I would sleep. O
Fatmeh, take my father away that I may sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>Fatmeh followed the sheykh to the door, and
clutched his robe.</p>

<p>“Hear me, O my lord!” she whispered. “She
is not better; she cannot sleep. What can one do?
I will tell thee. Be not wroth with thy servant.
There is a tree not far from here—a good tree and
efficacious, for all thy frowns—one that has healed
thousands. Let me tear off a strip from her finest
garment and go myself and hang it on the tree. So,
in sh’ Allah, she will be healed and no one know the
manner of her healing. Cast me not off. Hear
only, I entreat thee. Let us make but trial of the
tree. How can it be a bad tree? Did not Allah
make it with the others?”</p>

<p>“Be silent!” said Shems-ud-dìn sternly. “Allah
forbid that one of my house should commit so
great an impiety!” With which he passed out from
her and shut the door.</p>

<p>By that time the evening shadow covered town
and hillside; only the summit of the minaret shone
like the henna-dyed tip of a finger pointed heavenward.
But the cliffs across the wady still basked in
broad sunlight. The figure of the old negro, lounging
in the archway, stood out darkly on that distant
glow.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn sat down in the entrance and remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
in profound meditation, his every thought a
prayer; while the flower of sunset bloomed and faded
upon the cliffs beyond the wady, and blue night stole
upon the landscape. Then, out in the gloaming, a
cry arose—a long-sustained yell, breaking anon into
a wild unearthly chant. It came from the minaret,
which the piety of Shems-ud-dìn himself had added
to the little mosque. Its burden of memories brought
tears to the old man’s eyes.</p>

<p>He arose and went out on to the roof of his
house. A star sparkled on the fading green of sunset.
A cool breath from the hills fanned his cheeks.
Falling on his face toward the kibleh, he prayed
Allah to abate something of his too great love for
Alia, which had broken the calm of resignation becoming
his age, which hung as a cloud between him
and the Creator.</p>

<p>When he regained the porch, old Mâs was hanging
up a lantern to a hook on the wall.</p>

<p>“O Mâs, go to the house of the excellent Hassan
Agha; if he be within, beg him to honor me with his
presence here.”</p>

<p>“No need,” grinned the black. “Even now I
hear his honor’s voice without.”</p>

<p>In confirmation, there came a shout, “Peace on
this house!” and the Guardian of the Frontier appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
in the entrance arch. Behind him a crowd of
heads, but dimly seen, were bowed reverently. Hassan’s
men—a fierce-eyed, swaggering crew—followed
him about always like tame dogs. With a shrug
and his grin, Mâs went off to pound coffee for the
invaders.</p>

<p>“What is this I hear of thee, O my eyes? Thou
goest to El Cûds under advice of an angel from
Allah? Shibli told me the strange story as I rode
through the bazaar at sunset,” said Hassan, after
salutations. “Hopest thou still for the girl? By
my gun, it grieves me to see thee seek the cause of
misfortune, going groping like a blind man, when
the cause is plain to all besides thee. Thou hast let
the girl grow between thee and the Praiseworthy;
wherefore the Almighty slays her, as one breaks the
small branch of a tree, that He may see thee. What
do I with my mare if one praises her too warmly, so
that my pride in her leaps up to flout the Most High?
I say piously: she is thine. I give her in haste to
him who extols her. I put the occasion of sin from
me. And so I would do with my daughter did I sin
through her.”</p>

<p>“The right is with thee, O Hassan,” said Shems-ud-dìn,
in great distress. “But—O my pearl of
pearls! O my Alia! O young moon rising on my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
night of years! Darkness were my portion without
thee! My woman is dead, and I have not the heart
to enjoy another. My son is far away, and his love
grows cold. I have received no answer from him
these many months. But my Alia—she is here,
my soul itself. Allah forgive me, I must try to
keep her.”</p>

<p>“I say naught against that, O my eyes, but only
against the extravagance of thy love for her. Obey
the angel certainly. The Franks have skill in medicine—more
especially that tribe of them which is
called the English. One Englishman, who was in
Kars during the siege, healed my father’s brother,
and a thousand others who were counted dead of the
Yellow Wind. The power to cure is their inheritance
from Isa the Prophet, the mighty healer.
Proceed to El Cûds. Thou art like to behold thy son
there, by what I heard to-day from the mouth of a
camel driver from that city who had much to tell
of one Abd-ur-Rahman Bey, an officer in the garrison,
and nephew to the glorious Milhem Pasha. It can
mean no other than our friend, thy son. He came
thither from Istanbûl three months ago.”</p>

<p>“Three months!” ejaculated Shems-ud-dìn, with
downcast eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly thou must journey to El Cûds, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
only that the sight of him may refresh thy soul. But
tell me, O my dear, what is the right of this story
of an angel? Shibli said only that an angel had appeared
to thee, and bidden thee take him (Shibli) to
El Cûds, for the sake of Alia, somehow.”</p>

<p>“Not so,” said Shems-ud-dìn. “The truth is
quite otherwise. Indeed, it is more likely that he who
appeared to me was a devil.” Therewith he told
the plain story, the Circassians listening with open
mouths.</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah! A jinni, very surely,” said Hassan,
at the end. “I myself observed something peculiar
in his aspect. Not often is so long a train of
camels sent forth without money in the hands of the
drivers. Yet—believe it, who can!—on three men,
having charge of more than fifty camels, we found
but half a bishlik, two poor knives, one brass button,
and a bottle—a very small bottle—of attar of roses.
No doubt, but the man was an afrìt, who spoke with
thee. Devils love to attack a saint, just as I would
rather kill a big, strong Bedawi than a little weak
one, when it comes to avenging their slaughter of my
two sons. Yet fear not, O my soul! A man of thy
works can laugh at all the jân. I myself will journey
with thee, and, while the Frank physician heals thy
daughter, I, with Allah’s help, will procure new rifles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
for my comrades, a great supply being lately come
to the garrison there.”</p>

<p>Hassan paused to think awhile, stroking his heavy
white mustache.</p>

<p>“Yes; a devil, very certainly; perhaps even Eblìs
in person—Allah knows! The thing is proved.
You have heard, all of you here, how a devil cannot
profit by the gift of a holy one; how the gift will
presently return from him? Well, behold this small
bottle of attar of roses!”</p>

<p>He held up the phial so that all could see. A
shudder of applause ran round the circle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>

</div>

<p>Two hours before daybreak, Mâs, the negro,
stood on the hill of ruins with a donkey saddled and
bridled. One of his hands grasped the tail of the ass
for insurance against braying; the other held a lantern,
its rays diverted from the house of Shems-ud-dìn.
Mâs looked up at the stars with a dissatisfied
grunt. He observed in his soul:</p>

<p>“Now Allah correct all women! She whispers,
‘At the seventh hour be ready for Alia’s sake,’ and
I leave my couch and the comfort God sends to me in
dreams—the rich banquet and the palace of gurgling
fountains, the sweet brides, and my youth restored—I
forsake all that, because of her whispering, and I
saddle the ass and take light in my hand, and stand
out here in the chill——”</p>

<p>A noise of cautious and uncertain footsteps here
broke his reflections. He stood intent to listen. All
at once came the rattle of stones displaced, a thud,
a smothered scream. Promptly he turned the lantern
so as to throw light on the disaster.</p>

<p>A woman, closely veiled and muffled, rose slowly
up from off a heap of refuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“Is it thou, O Mâs? Praise to Allah! Say,
what was it smote me that I fell?”</p>

<p>“Come,” said Mâs simply.</p>

<p>Fatmeh tottered forward and clutched tight hold
of the negro.</p>

<p>“O Mâs, I dare go no farther. Take thou this
piece of raiment—the raiment of the beloved—and
go and hang it on the blessed tree.”</p>

<p>“Alone?” Mâs laughed to scorn the notion.
“I love the dear one, but go alone by night to a
chosen haunt of devils, I will not! In the daytime
ask me.”</p>

<p>“Allah forbid! Is it not a secret for the dark
to hide that thou sayest ‘in the daytime’? ‘The
daytime!’ Allah, listen!”</p>

<p>“Since our lord gave thee leave to go, what is
to hide?”</p>

<p>“Leave! Allah knows he has given leave
enough. A sin, indeed, if recourse might be had to
Frankish wizards and not to that gentle tree!”</p>

<p>“Then come. We waste time.”</p>

<p>Seeing she would still have tarried, scolding, Mâs
lifted her up and placed her bodily upon the donkey’s
back. Then taking the headrope in his hand, he
strode forward.</p>

<p>No sooner did Fatmeh recover breath than she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
began to inveigh against all male creatures, but principally
those on whom the wrath of God is manifest
in a black hide. Things, she declared, were come
to a pretty pass when a slave dared order the goings
of his mistress, and carry her whither she would not.
But to all her tirades Mâs replied tranquilly:</p>

<p>“Since when art thou my lady? Thou art not
all thou wouldst be.”</p>

<p>After a time words failed her. Only a moan,
when some exceptional roughness made her bump the
pack saddle, assured Mâs that she was still there behind
him. At length she besought him, whimpering:</p>

<p>“O Mâs, speak to me; I am afraid. Tell me, O
kind Mâs, a story to beguile the way.”</p>

<p>“I know no story.”</p>

<p>“Sing then. For the love of Allah, sing a little.”</p>

<p>“I will not; for the jân love music. When the
day comes, then perhaps I will sing.”</p>

<p>Fatmeh appealed to Allah against such hardness
of heart. She looked up at the stars for comfort.
But the folds of her veil obscured the view of them,
and when she looked down again the darkness seemed
alive. Save the clap of her donkey’s hoofs, there
was no sound audible upon those unseen hills. The
ray from the lantern danced on ahead like an evil
spirit. All at once, to her horror, the dark earth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
yawned before her, spinning dizzily to a shape, like
clay upon the potter’s wheel. In a trice there was a
vast black bowl, in whose depths glowed fire, small
specks that grew and joined, dwindled, and grew
again till all else vanished. She lurched forward,
groping for Mâs; but in the gloom her hands missed
him, and she fell to the ground.</p>

<p>When she came to herself again, she was dazzled
by the light of the lantern shining full in her eyes.
Mâs bent over her, his black face burnished in the
light.</p>

<p>“Y’ Allah! What ails thee? Come, arise,
I say.”</p>

<p>She moaned: “Woe on us! The fires! The
fires of punishment!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” smiled Mâs, as seeing light at last.
“There is a camp down there in that wady—whether
of the Bedû or the gypsies, Allah knows.
Now come, since thou art not dead.”</p>

<p>Again he lifted her on to the broad saddle.
Again an impenetrable darkness closed about them.
But she was no more afraid. Having passed the extreme
of horror, whole by a miracle, all else that
might befall seemed light to bear.</p>

<p>A whiteness crept up somewhere behind the night.
Soon, with the vagueness and the ceaseless jogging,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
she fell asleep, and awoke to find herself in a plain,
somewhat cup-shaped, rimmed with jagged rocks.
Something gaunt and monstrous, which appeared
writhing, yet was still, stood in the way against them.
It was the tree.</p>

<p>With a thankful heart she slid down from off the
bruising saddle. She took from her bosom the strip
of Alia’s raiment and gave it to Mâs, who was tall
and could reach the branches.</p>

<p>“It is finished,” he said presently, with satisfaction.</p>

<p>Light increased with every minute. Mâs, having
put out the lantern, withdrew from her and went
and knelt upon the ground, his left shoulder toward
the dawn. But Fatmeh, sitting huddled beneath the
magic tree, knew not, nor cared to know, what he
was doing. She wept in repentance of her great
audacity.</p>

<p>She was aroused by a sound unexpected and terrible—the
gallop of many steeds. The noise drew
near apace. A voice cried:</p>

<p>“Halt at the tree and rest.”</p>

<p>At that she flung herself face downward upon the
ground and knew no more, until a conversation arose
so close to her that it was matter for wonder how the
speakers escaped contact with her body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>“It is a Bedawi, I say.”</p>

<p>“It is some beast.”</p>

<p>“Pronounce, O Nesìb the Thief, thou lord of
two good eyes. What seest thou?”</p>

<p>“I see nothing marvelous. Yonder is a man in
white raiment, praying toward Mekka. And here,
not far distant, is a black donkey at grass, bearing a
pack saddle, but no load thereon.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Is there light to tell black from
white?”</p>

<p>“Others may not, but the Thief can surely.”</p>

<p>“The man is a Bedawi. Let us take his head
with the others. So shall my sons be avenged. Praise
be to Allah! We know now that they go to El
Cûds, these dogs; and we go also to El Cûds. Are
they not between our two hands?... Yon wretch
has finished his prayers. Let us slay him and reap
his head.... What kind of man is he? I cannot
see for the light beyond.”</p>

<p>Fatmeh could bear it no longer. She screamed
aloud in her alarm for Mâs. Immediately she was
seized and lifted, struggling, to her feet. Men
thronged upon her. She smelt men and horses.</p>

<p>They had pulled aside her veil, yet knew not who
she was; not one of them had seen her face before.
Her knees gave way, her tongue clove to the roof<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
of her mouth. She could only moan and whimper
under indignities, and think with terror of the Sheykh
Shems-ud-dìn. For disobedience this shame was
come upon her.</p>

<p>“Stop! Hold your hands!... O my lord
Hassan, I beseech thee, let her go. She is of
the house of my master, the Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn,”
cried the voice of a man out of breath—the voice
of Mâs.</p>

<p>On the instant, as it seemed to her, she was free.
She straightened her veil, clutching for support at the
saddle of the horse nearest to her. But instead of
the saddle her touch encountered the bristled skin
of a head—a man’s head. She gave one look ere
her shriek went forth. There were two of them,
with bloated tongues protruding.</p>

<p>At her cries a laugh went up from the horsemen.</p>

<p>“Wilt ride with me?” asked Hassan Agha.
“It falls not often to the lot of woman to roll two
men’s heads at once upon her knees. Have no fear,
my daughter. They shall not bite thee.... Nesìb
and thou, Ali, stay and guard these people. Be
mindful to use them with respect for the sake of the
saintly Shems-ud-dìn, to whose house they belong.
Allah be with you.”</p>

<p>He had risen in the act to spur his horse, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
Fatmeh, repressing her terror of the ghastly heads,
caught his stirrup.</p>

<p>“O my lord!” she entreated, “of thy goodness
breathe no word to the sheykh, my master. He
knows naught of my coming hither——”</p>

<p>Hassan cut short her prayer with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Then say nothing to thy lord of my two heads.
Call it a bargain, O my dear!”</p>

<p>And he rode off at speed with his men in the
sun’s first rays.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>

</div>

<p>When Shems-ud-dìn set forth from the town,
there was great excitement. Babes were held up by
their parents to watch the saint ride by. A cry arose
that he should bless the place; and he did so, sitting
on his old white horse, adorned with old trappings
of scarlet and light blue and gold which had not
seen service for twenty years. The little city on its
hillside, then, in the early sunlight, looked restful as
a flock of sheep at noon. There were tears in the
sheykh’s eyes as he turned and rode away.</p>

<p>He rode alone, with eyes downcast, his beard
upon his breast, never far from the palanquin which
contained Alia and her nurse. Shibli, in the pride
of youth, galloped ahead with the Circassians, the
sunshine glancing from their accouterments as they
darted in and out of the shadows flung by great rocks
across their path.</p>

<p>The poles of the women’s litter were borne by
two mules, one in front and one behind. Beside the
hinder trudged Mâs, armed with a long goad. He
crooned as he walked a sad song without end, some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
echo of his long-lost childhood in hot Darfur. Now
and then a groan came from within the litter, and
Fatmeh was heard soothing her charge. Once the
curtains parted, and Alia looked forth smiling at
her father.</p>

<p>“How is thy health?” he asked earnestly.</p>

<p>“The better for being free of that dark chamber,
that hateful town, always the same smells, the same
thoughts. Now, in the sun and sweet air, I am well,
O my father!”</p>

<p>“In sh’ Allah!” murmured Shems-ud-dìn, and
he bowed his head.</p>

<p>But as the heat increased, and shadows shrank
away, nothing but moans came from within the palanquin.
The Circassians, tired of display, came back
one by one. Shibli, ranging his steed alongside that
of Shems-ud-dìn, prattled incessantly without regard
for his listener. The sheykh heard the talk around
him as a buzzing of flies.</p>

<p>“What gift bearest thou to the Frank physician,
O Nesìb?” cried one of the riders to his comrade
near at hand.</p>

<p>“A fine one, O my eyes! I bear an old-time garment,
the best of my inheritance. It belonged to my
father’s father, and has been as an heirloom in the
family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>“Capital! Allah will give to thee.... For
my part, I take a trifle, a mere nothing. The chief’s
command was on every man to bring some present in
his hand. And I had nothing, being a young one,
newly married. But I remembered to have seen
clouds of bees upon a certain rock in the wady below
our house. So I went, bearing fire with me,
and slew those bees and took their honey, a portion
of which is here in my saddlebags. My woman
wrapped it for me and put it in a jar. In sh’ Allah,
the infidel will accept of it.”</p>

<p>“In sh’ Allah, but it is no great thing,” returned
he of the garment.</p>

<p>They proceeded by the easiest and clearest road,
which was also by much the longest, so that for the
sake of the litter they spent four hours upon a distance
which the horsemen alone could have covered
in less than two.</p>

<p>At length they reached a little plain, or cup-shaped
hollow, among the hills, in the midst of
which stood an ancient terebinth full three parts
dead. A number of rags hanging from the withered
branches gave to that tree a curious bearded
look.</p>

<p>“We will halt awhile in its shade,” said Hassan,
who had assumed the chief command. “The sun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
is hot; and after a little, Allah sends to us the midday
breeze, when it will be more pleasant riding.”</p>

<p>At that Shibli, with a shout, set off galloping
toward the tree. At his shout a flight of small birds
forsook its branches and flew, wavering, with faint
tweets, toward the northern hillside. With a scream
of delight, the youth unslung the gun from his back,
leveled it, and fired after the birds. In a second his
horse was standing on its hind legs, and he himself lay
on his back among the stones. His gun had flown a
great way off, in another direction.</p>

<p>A roar of laughter went up from the cavalcade.
The women peeped forth, tittering, between the curtains
of the palanquin. Only Shems-ud-dìn betrayed
concern.</p>

<p>“Art hurt, O my son?” he inquired, dismounting
amid a general stampede in chase of Shibli’s
horse, which was by that time careering madly
across the plain, showing the flat of its hind hoofs
to the pursuit.</p>

<p>“This is a lesson,” said Hassan Agha, chuckling.
“Boys must learn from Allah! Did not I warn thee
to have a care in handling thy gun? Did not I tell
thee how to sit for firing—bridle dropped, feet forward,
pressing the stirrups? Yet when the time
came, thy feet were somewhere behind thee and thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
didst drag up the bridle. Another time, perhaps,
thou wilt remember.”</p>

<p>Shibli arose, crestfallen, tears trickling down his
cheeks. He admitted with shame that he was unhurt.</p>

<p>The litter was set down in the shade. The beasts
were hobbled and turned loose. The men who had
gone in pursuit of the runaway returned successful,
their horses panting and half-blind with sweat. All
crowded together beneath the tree.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn sat with his back to the trunk, where
the shade was darkest. It was nowhere a continuous
blot of shade, but rather like a net enmeshing forms
and faces. Nesìb the Thief, who had brought a
waterskin along with him, gave to drink in a horn
cup, to the sheykh first, and then to all the company;
not forgetting the women, upon whose needs Mâs
waited.</p>

<p>By and by, as they sat in drowsy converse, came
a sighing of the branches overhead. Flowers that
grew among the stones swayed a little. It was as
though a cool hand fell on every brow. The breeze
which tempers noon had found them out.</p>

<p>Throughout the halt Shems-ud-dìn gazed straight
before him, or else upon the ground at his feet. Not
until Hassan gave the word to remount did he raise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
his eyes in thanksgiving for that half-hour’s refreshment.
They remained fixed in awful contemplation.</p>

<p>From the lowest branch of the tree, just overhead,
hung a strip of brightness, fluttering, among
other similar strips by no means bright. This strip
was new, the rest were very old. Moreover, a sunbeam
threading the maze of twigs had singled it out
for illumination. The sheykh stared and stared.
Those colors—green and white in stripes, with a slender
thread of crimson down the green—were most
familiar. He had bought a piece of silk of that
pattern not long ago of a traveling merchant, and
had made of it a garment for Alia.</p>

<p>He turned toward the litter. A hush had fallen
on the group around him.</p>

<p>“O Fatmeh, come forth! Whence is this silken
rag? How comes it to hang here?”</p>

<p>“Rag! What rag?” screamed the woman,
creeping out through the curtains. “Allah witness!
What have I to do with it? Is it my tree that I
should be held accountable for all that grows on it?
Allah forbid!...”</p>

<p>Her voice, which had arisen shrill and brazen,
soon quavered and broke. The grins of the Circassians
cut the ground from under her. She fell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
on her face before Shems-ud-dìn, in a paroxysm of
repentance.</p>

<p>“How often have I forbidden thee all traffic with
this tree? A wrong to myself I had forgiven; but
this is an insult to the providence of God. Henceforth
I wash my two hands of thee. Return to thy
kindred, and may Allah bless thee!”</p>

<p>Fatmeh rolled on the ground in convulsions of
shame and grief. She shrieked to the bystanders to
slay her then and there. But the sheykh stood by
his horse, obdurate. He surveyed her contortions
without mercy, till a new voice of lamentation smote
his ear.</p>

<p>“O Lord!... O my father!... Be not so
wicked!... O Allah, turn my father’s heart to
pity! Wouldst thou slay me quite, now, immediately?
Thou knowest I am nothing without Fatmeh!
I will die—yes, die now—and punish thy
wickedness. Oh, woe upon us! Woe! Woe!”</p>

<p>The thin face of Alia looked forth unveiled between
the curtains. It was distorted with pain and
fury, most ugly to look upon. Shibli made a wry
face behind her father’s back. It was the first time
for many months that he had seen the likeness of his
betrothed.</p>

<p>The sheykh stood gaping, at a loss for a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>“Arise, O woman, and resume thy place beside
her,” he said at last lamely.</p>

<p>The spectators smiled and shrugged shoulders
one at another. But in a moment their looks
changed to horror.</p>

<p>The Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn lifted his right arm
and, taking hold of the bright rag, pulled with might.
The silk tore with the shriek of a living thing. He
threw it away and straight remounted his horse, heedless
of the piercing cries of Fatmeh.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>

</div>

<p>The first night of travel was spent at a village
occupied by a colony of Circassians. Here, naturally,
they met with a warm welcome. The guest
chamber of the head man was allotted to Hassan and
Shems-ud-dìn; Alia and Fatmeh were accommodated
in the same house; and the rest of the party found
hospitable quarters, though the most part slept, from
choice, under the open sky.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn retired early, craving leave to
mount to the housetop and drink the fresh air of
night. For long he paced the terrace roof in the
darkness, then sat crosslegged awhile, then, as his
limbs felt cramp, arose and walked again.</p>

<p>The great heart of the night beat loud in his ears,
and he fancied he could hear respirations, as its cool
breath fanned his cheeks.</p>

<p>By and by the eastern hill grew black and imminent;
a coronal of light appeared; and the moon
pushed up her horn, a golden spearpoint against the
stars. The flat-roofed houses took shape suddenly,
cube by cube. A minute since they had been lost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
in night’s mystery, at one with the dim hills, the
starry sky.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn’s prayer ceased not. He prayed
for strength in submission. An instant fear haunted
him, making this night most terrible. He thought
that God would take the life of Alia at once, without
delay, and so ratify the covenant of the tree. In
tearing down the idolatrous rag from off the branch,
he had accepted his daughter’s death at the hand of
the Lord. He prayed for perfect resignation. But
a wish would outrun the prayer—oh, that Allah
would appoint some other victim, as He did of old
for Ibrahìm, His friend!</p>

<p>With the first dawn he went down into the house
to wash before the morning prayer. When his host
inquired if he had spent a happy night, he answered
Yes, and thanked him kindly. Alia yet lived; nay,
Fatmeh pronounced her better than on their arrival
the evening before. So the sunrise smiled to
him.</p>

<p>That day their road led through a forest of terebinths,
not dense, but growing singly, or else by
clumps of two and three. The path was pied with
shade, affording a pleasant diversity; and Alia often
looked out from the palanquin with cheerful words
to her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>It was late afternoon when they came forth from
among the trees. From a bald crown they surveyed
a waste of yellow hills tossed and crumpled in the
likeness of a stormy sea. They halted, without dismounting,
to inhale the keen air of those highlands.</p>

<p>Of a sudden Hassan laughed out, and pointed to
the valley right below them. In the midst of a green-stained
dell swelled a brown mound, in shape nearly
oval. By one end of the mound moved a camel, by
the other a man.</p>

<p>“He must have been to sleep,” laughed Hassan,
“and have let go the rope. And now if he catch it
ere the Day of Judgment, it will surprise me.”</p>

<p>When the man stole round to one side of the
hillock, his camel, which till then had been browsing
peacefully, lifted its head and stepped round to the
other. They could see the headrope dangling as
it ran.</p>

<p>The man stood still, in thought apparently; for
soon, as if struck by a new idea, he started to climb
the mound. From the top he caught sight of the
camel beneath him, placidly chewing. They could
hear his yell of triumph as he rushed down upon it.
But he pitched headlong—and by the time he reached
level ground his camel was not there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>The man sat nursing himself.</p>

<p>“Now he weeps, I assure you,” cried Hassan,
exultant.</p>

<p>“Let us go down and help the poor man,” said
Shems-ud-dìn.</p>

<p>“No, that we will not! It were a sin! But I
am with thee, my dear, to go down and hear his tale.
It must be a rare one. Ma sh’ Allah!”</p>

<p>Already Shibli and the younger men were urging
their horses down the steep decline. Old Hassan
followed at a breakneck pace. Only Shems-ud-dìn
and Mâs the negro stayed by the litter. Care for
the sick girl obliging them to descend very slowly,
step by step, by the time they reached the foot the
rest of the party had been some time gathered round
the lord of that froward camel. Shems-ud-dìn drew
near the group.</p>

<p>The fellâh was about finishing his tale of woe.
He moaned:</p>

<p>“O Lord, I possess but this one only, and a
person in Es-Salt, the lord of much wealth, would
buy him of me for a journey he makes to-morrow.
The price offered is a high one. I would fain receive
it. But to-morrow will be too late; the merchant will
have gone his way. Would to Allah I had not lain
down to sleep! Would that I had never been born<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
to need sleep upon the earth! Be kind now, I entreat
you, O my masters! Help me to recover my camel.”</p>

<p>But the Circassians, and Shibli with them, mocked
his anguish, saying:</p>

<p>“We sympathize with thee, that is understood.
But we be plain men. We meddle not with signs
and wonders. Who ever saw the like of this thy
quandary? Surely it is upon thee from the hand
of Allah.”</p>

<p>At that the poor man put his knuckles to his eyes
and wept aloud, cursing the stock of men so heartless.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn frowned upon their wickedness.
He was about to use his authority on the man’s
behalf when lo! the camel itself came striding round
a shoulder of the hill and stood within a few paces of
him. The rest beheld not the chance, intent on their
evil game.</p>

<p>Very quietly the sheykh walked his horse toward
the great beast, which watched his approach without
concern, nor demurred even when he grasped the
headrope.</p>

<p>“O fellâh, behold thy camel!”</p>

<p>For a moment all were petrified. Then wild
cries arose: “A wonder!”—“A sign from Allah!”—“The
Lord has ordained a miracle at the hand of
the saintly Shems-ud-dìn!”—“Run, O poor man!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Make haste to kiss the earth between his horse’s
feet!”</p>

<p>The fellâh did as they bade him. He ran, and
falling on the ground, flattened himself before the
horse of Shems-ud-dìn, crying:</p>

<p>“Deign to ride over me, O favored of Allah!
Behold, I am the dust of thy pathway!”</p>

<p>The sheykh made him rise, and explained to him
the occurrence as most natural. “Seeing thou hadst
ceased from pursuing, thy camel tired of playing
alone and came of his own accord to look for
thee.”</p>

<p>But the owner of the camel would not be convinced,
any more than would the bystanders, that the
event was less than a miracle. The Circassians congratulated
one another, whispering:</p>

<p>“Now is it clear that he knows the language of
beasts; for how else could he read the mind of this
camel, that he is tired of playing alone? By Allah,
he is no less than a prophet. Praise to the Highest,
who has made us his companions.”</p>

<p>“Where sleep you to-night?” asked the camel’s
master, wiping his eyes on the sleeve of his robe.</p>

<p>They answered him: “At Es-Salt, whither thou
also goest.”</p>

<p>“Good. Then I travel with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the journey, which was
very monotonous, the eyes of that fellâh dwelt upon
Shems-ud-dìn, raptly staring as at a vision. In the
town of Es-Salt it would have been hard to find a
lodging for the women, since the only khan was filled
with a caravan bound to Bûsra from the Holy City;
but this man took them to the house of a friend of
his, who, on hearing the case explained, turned out
with his family into the adjoining stable, and so made
room for them. And when Shems-ud-dìn arose in
the morning and looked forth, there was this same
man squatting patiently beside the threshold.</p>

<p>At sight of the sheykh, he fell down and kissed
his feet.</p>

<p>“May thy day be happy, O my master! I seek
a boon of thee. Grant me but leave to journey with
thee to the Holy Place. I will be no charge upon
thee; for I have this hour received the price of my
camel.”</p>

<p>“But thy business!—thy house!—thy woman!”</p>

<p>“Those are always with me. They await my
return. But as for thee, thou passest. It is an occasion
to be seized.”</p>

<p>“But—Merciful Allah!—I travel not for pastime,
O my son.”</p>

<p>“I know, O my lord. Thy companions have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
already told me; and I sorrow with thee. How is
the health of the lady, thy daughter, this morning?”</p>

<p>“In sh’ Allah, it is no worse. She yet lives,”
said Shems-ud-dìn sadly.</p>

<p>“May Allah heal her quickly! Deign now to
give me the saddlebags. I will make ready the horse
for thy Grace.”</p>

<p>He would not be gainsaid.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>

</div>

<p>When the cavalcade assembled without the town,
this new companion came riding upon the sorriest ass
ever seen, which, it transpired, he had borrowed from
a friend. He took all the laughter at his expense
in excellent part.</p>

<p>His name, he said, was Zeyd the son of Abbâs.
He had been born in El Arìsh, toward the country of
Masr, but had not beheld that place for many years.
Bred to the calling of a muleteer, he had led a wandering
life from childhood. It was now three years
since he had settled down in a certain village, about
six hours distant from the spot where they had found
him at hide and seek with his camel. He had taken
to wife a girl of that place, and was fairly prosperous
as poor men reckon.</p>

<p>Not half of all he said reached Shems-ud-dìn’s
ears, which were strained toward the palanquin; but
a word of courteous acquiescence contented Zeyd.</p>

<p>They came to the end of the highlands in a bare
brown shoulder thrust out over a chasm wide and
deep, no mere wady of the hills like those they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
hitherto traversed, but a trench cut below the surface
of the world. It parted the mountain lands to east
and west. Upon the plain in its depths, through
mists of heat, they could see the belt of foliage coiling
like a snake, which marked the course of the
river. In the south, at no great distance, the valley
widened to inclose a dazzling sheet the eye avoided,
a memorial of God’s wrath, the Sea of Lot.</p>

<p>Here they came up with the Circassians and
Shibli, who had stopped for consultation.</p>

<p>“What sayest thou, O my dear?” cried Hassan.
“Shall we rest to-night in the plain yonder; or, for
the day is yet young, shall we push on nearer to El
Cûds? Decide, I pray thee.”</p>

<p>“Let us hasten onward,” replied Shems-ud-dìn.</p>

<p>His prayer all yesterday and this morning had
been that Alia might die in a house peacefully, that
death might deal gently with her, as would not be
the case did she expire amid the jolt and rocking of
that crazy palanquin. He was therefore for pushing
on as far as might be.</p>

<p>But soon after they began to descend, the path
being steep and rough so that the mules moved
jerkily with frequent slips, a shriek came from
Fatmeh within the litter; and when all halted and
crowded round, Alia was discovered lifeless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>Mâs, with the ready help of Zeyd ebn Abbâs,
lifted her out and bore her, duly veiled, to where a
jutting rock spread a fan of shadow. Everyone
thought her dead.</p>

<p>But Fatmeh, with a snort of contempt, bade them
all stand back. She removed the veil from the girl’s
face, and began to chafe one of her hands, bidding
Shems-ud-dìn do the like with the other; she wetted
her fingers in her mouth and laid them to Alia’s
forehead; with the result that presently the life returned.
Alia drew a gasping breath and her eyelids
fluttered.</p>

<p>“Praise to Allah!” cried the onlookers.</p>

<p>“Praise to Allah, in truth!” cried Fatmeh, with
a point of scorn. “Small praise to anyone else here
present! It is the fatigue, of course, O my poor one,
O my dove! How should it be otherwise when she
has been jarred so many hours in yonder box, which
would kill even a jinni, I think, with its lurch and the
creak of the poles. Let her lie in peace to-day, and
she may live to see El Cûds. Hurry on, and she will
die on the way! Allah knows that, for truth.”</p>

<p>There could be no further question as to where
they should halt for the night. Alia was carried
back to the litter, and they resumed their march down
into El Ghûr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>They reached the plain a little before noon, and
dismounted near a village of seeming ant hills at
the foot of a thicket, on this side the ford. Here
food was procured for the sick girl—curds and fruit,
and rice boiled with the daintiest parts of a fowl—of
which she took but a mouthful ere resigning the
dish to Fatmeh. But she drank deep from a pitcher
of cold pure water, and lay back, seeming refreshed.
The women abode in the litter set down
in the shade of some trees, the hovels of the village
appearing to Shems-ud-dìn far too wretched to receive
them.</p>

<p>The repast ended, Hassan and the rest crossed
the river and strolled off in various directions. Only
Shems-ud-dìn and Zeyd ebn Abbâs stayed with Mâs
beside the litter. The last named busied himself in
constructing a rough booth with boughs and reeds
and grass, and garments borrowed from one and
another. Shems-ud-dìn sat in a state between prayer
and meditation, observed with reverence by his new
disciple. The soothing voice of Fatmeh, the voice
of a nursing mother lulling her babe to sleep, blent
with the coo of doves among the trees. A knot of
villagers watched from a distance, impressed by the
stillness of the strange men.</p>

<p>At length, when shades grew long to eastward,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and Mâs, having finished his work, had gone to bathe
in the river, Zeyd ventured to say:</p>

<p>“Deign to teach me somewhat, O my master.”</p>

<p>“In the name of Allah, gladly,” consented Shems-ud-dìn,
starting to consciousness.</p>

<p>Taking suggestion from the scene around them,
he told of Lût and Ibrahìm the Friend, and how
Allah destroyed the wicked cities which once stood
where now the bitter sea shone gold to the setting
sun. The villagers—men, women, and little children—approached
to listen, edging nearer shyly,
like wild things fascinated, till they formed a half-circle
before the narrator. Soft breathed “Ma sh’
Allah!” punctuated his discourse. The Circassians,
returning by twos and threes, lounged upon
the ground within earshot. “It is a great saint,
hear him! None like him in all the world!” they
whispered to the breathless fellahìn; till Shems-ud-dìn
observed how they whispered among themselves,
and ceased speaking, in some annoyance. Till then
he had been scarce aware of their presence. It was
no time for preaching, his sorrow told him, nor for
aught else wherein his soul took pride.</p>

<p>The villagers stole up, one by one, to kiss his hand,
and he suffered it, but begged them to withdraw;
which they presently did, with many a backward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
look. Certain of the women returned at nightfall,
bringing slabs of bread, and earthen bowls full of
curds and cooked meats, which they set upon the
ground near him. They stayed not to haggle over
the price, but took what was offered them and
went away.</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah!” said Hassan Agha, with his
thunderous laugh. “It is good to travel with a holy
one. To-morrow, it is likely, we shall find coined
gold instead of stones in our path. Know also,
O light of my eyes, that our enemies are delivered
into our hands, an easy prey. The Lord knows we
must thank thy sanctity for it, under Allah. Some
dwellers in the House of Hair camp ahead of us
within that crease of the mountain to be seen from
here. My own eyes have beheld them. And one, a
pilgrim to Neby Mûsa, who stood near, told me all
there is to know concerning them.</p>

<p>“They are infidels, coming of a southern tribe
which of old was perverted from the Faith; and they
go now to keep the feast of the Nazarenes, which is
nothing but a battle between two rival factions of
that sect, decided annually in the church, called the
Resurrection, in El Cûds. This fight is all their
observance; for the rest, they have no religion more
than other wild beasts. It is good to exterminate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
such men. In sh’ Allah, we shall slay every one of
them or ever they behold the city. So shall my sons
be avenged!”</p>

<p>“Be not so wicked in thy thoughts,” said Shems-ud-dìn
sternly. “What are these men to thee?
These slew not thy sons!”</p>

<p>Hassan shrugged up his shoulders, and began to
roll a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Am I Allah, to tell one sparrow from his
brother?”</p>

<p>“Thou wouldst not shed innocent blood!”</p>

<p>“Is their blood innocent? Allah knows: let
Him decide. I know that men like to these in appearance
slew my two sons ten years ago....”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn arose quivering. “Now Allah
reckon with thee at the Last Day! Fight while we
travel together, and I leave thee without a blessing!
Allah witness, it is my last word!”</p>

<p>“Well,” growled Hassan after a long pause,
“let there be truce for a day or two till we arrive in
El Cûds. There, if they push against us in those
narrow streets, I cannot swear to restrain the hands
of my followers. But till then, peace. Thy blessing
is dearer than the blood of dogs, beloved!”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Shems-ud-dìn; and, wrapped in his
white cloak, he lay down to sleep upon the ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
before the bower which Mâs had built, where slept
the women.</p>

<p>So it befell, on the morrow, that a troop of horsemen
overtaken upon the mountain road went unmolested.
The men had swarthy faces, dark eyes of a
smoldering fire, and they spoke pure Arabic with
a husky voice. There was a little friendly rivalry,
racing of horses and the like, between them and the
Circassians; but that was all.</p>

<p>“What doest thou?” inquired Shems-ud-dìn of
Zeyd ebn Abbâs, who rode with his eyes shut, muttering.</p>

<p>“I pray to Allah,” was the reply; and a little
later, when they had parted from the tribesmen: “I
praise Allah,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thou doest well, O my son.”</p>

<p>At a lonely khan, where the midday halt was
made, they found a company of Frankish travelers,
taking food from off a white cloth spread upon a flat
rock. It was a desert place. Blond crags towered
up wan against the rich blue; the world seemed of two
plain colors—earth and sky. The Franks made a
great clatter with knives and forks upon plates of
tin or some other metal. They laughed loud and
vacantly, rousing echoes among the cliffs. They
stared rudely at the newcomers, the palanquin in particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
attracting their curiosity. They pointed with
knife and fork at the object of their attention; and
one who stood by, having the countenance of an Arab
but the voice of a Frank, gave them information in
their own jargon.</p>

<p>When the foreigners had done eating, they clambered
up among the rocks and began to throw down
small stones, laughing consumedly for no reason.
Their guide was left alone upon the level space before
the little khan. Hassan approached him and entered
into conversation.</p>

<p>“Surely the Franks are possessed with devils,”
said Shibli to the sheykh excitedly. “See, they laugh
at nothing, they throw stones at nothing, yet rejoice
in their vanity. They reject the means which Allah
has provided, and eat with strange implements hard
to manipulate, making of their necessity a game of
skill. And their raiment. Saw a man ever such
clothes? The women, more especially; if, indeed,
they be women! Look now, I beseech thee, O my
master.”</p>

<p>“Wherefore look, O my son?” said Shems-ud-dìn
listlessly. Whereupon Zeyd, the son of Abbâs,
groaned like a camel, supposing those women to be
sinful beyond the common.</p>

<p>Anon Hassan returned from the dragoman, bearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
a face of news. He threw himself on the ground,
as one heart-weary, ere observing:</p>

<p>“The Holy City is full to overflowing, according
to that dog. Allah help all of us to find a lodging.
The Nazarenes fill every nook, and a cake of bread
is sold for a week’s wages. In sh’ Allah, it is not all
true, what the hog has told me.”</p>

<p>“Allah help us, in truth!” cried Shems-ud-dìn.
“We shall arrive too late to seek at once the Frank
physician. And the city is set on a hill—the air of it
is keen. My child will surely die. Allah teach us
how to proceed.”</p>

<p>“I will tell thee, O my master, and you also, O
companions of my lord,” exclaimed Zeyd ebn Abbâs
suddenly, with a joyful face. “The brother of my
wife’s sister’s husband’s father dwells not far from the
Holy Place, on this side, at a village of the hills. He
is not a rich man, but deign to stay the night with him,
and not he only, but the whole of my wife’s family
will be honored.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn took the speaker’s hand affectionately,
saying:</p>

<p>“Daily do I praise Allah for the loving kindness
of the poor. Surely God has sent thee, O Zeyd of
the open heart. The Lord increase thy wealth and
hold thee ever in His keeping.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>He rose then, and went to tell the women of
Zeyd’s offer and his conclusion to accept it. A cry
of “Praise to Allah!” escaped from both occupants
of the litter. After the glimpse they had just obtained
of Frankish manners, neither Alia herself nor Fatmeh
was in haste to behold the Frank physician.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>

</div>

<p>The hills were as negro heads about a fire; twilight,
olive-tinted and something luminous, flooded
every crevice of the land, as Shems-ud-dìn sat before
the house of Zeyd’s wife’s relation, beneath a tree
which grew there, concluding a letter to his son Abd-ur-Rahman.
The quality of the light obliged him to
hold his face close to the reed as it ran. All who
dwelt in that place, squatting round upon the stones,
watched him with awe and wonderment.</p>

<p>“After inquiry concerning thy dear health”—so
ran the screed—“I set forth to thee that, thy sister the
little Alia, having been ill a long while, and all which
medical science both local and illustrious could do having
proved vain, it occurred to me, by the permission
of Allah, and seemed no sin, that I should bring her,
thy sister aforesaid, to the city El Cûds, where, according
to one who spoke with me of this matter, there
are found foreign physicians of a science transcending
that of the physicians of our own nation; whither
therefore I bring her, having journeyed thus far by
the grace of Allah, and intending to abide here this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
night in the village below mentioned in the house of a
friend of one of my companions, a good, kind man,
may Allah bless him.</p>

<p>“And moreover I inform thee that all is so far
well with me, by the mercy of Allah, thy sister yet
alive, though weak and worn to the shadow of her
thou bearest in mind; but that hearing of the city that
it is full to overflowing of Nazarenes thronging to
their feast of the Resurrection, I think well to send
thee beforehand this word of our coming, that thou
mayest seek out a place where I and my companions
of the road, to the number of twenty men, may lodge
while we remain in the city; a long time or a short,
as Allah wills it; and to express my eager hope that
thou wilt meet us in the gate to-morrow early, to inform
us where the Frank physician dwells.</p>

<p>“Know further that Hassan, our old friend, is
with me, and many also of his people, and Shibli, my
pupil and thine ancient playfellow, who all for compassion
bear me company; that these all salute thee
with every blessing, and that I, thy father, yearn exceedingly
to embrace thee once again, and may Allah
preserve thee ever!”</p>

<p>This letter, a marvel of fine penmanship, though
written upon his lap in the failing light, he delivered
to one of the Circassians standing ready beside his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
horse. The villagers, who had squatted silent
throughout the writing, crowded now around the recipient,
craving leave but to glance at the superscription.
“Ma sh’ Allah!” they exclaimed, when it was
shown to them. The messenger, proud of his sudden
consequence, proceeded to read aloud for their delectation:</p>

<p>“‘To the most illustrious, the most glorious, the
most renowned, the most honored Excellency Abd-ur-Rahman
Bey, the most respectable, may Allah preserve
him ever!’ So it is written, O my uncles!”</p>

<p>And those simple ones heard with rapture, heads
bowed as at a blessing.</p>

<p>Then the messenger sprang into the saddle, and,
under guidance of a barelegged youth, rode off with
a clatter up the stony path between the houses, out
by olive groves to the open hill whose brow cut sharp
upon the last of sunset.</p>

<p>When the messenger returned, it was the third
hour of night. Shems-ud-dìn sat in the guest room of
the village, observed and questioned untiringly by the
group of elders. A throng of women, children, and
the younger men pressed to the open door, craning
their necks to peer within. All those bearded faces
lighted from below by a saucer lamp upon the floor
in their midst, backed by gigantic shadows, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
to tower upward indefinitely. The messenger bowed
low on entering, his hand on his breast.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn bent forward eagerly. “The answer,
O my son! Give me the answer. I praise
Allah for thy safe return.”</p>

<p>“There is no answer, O my lord,” replied the
messenger wearily. “On arrival in the city I rode
at once to the tower where the soldiers lodge. There
I made inquiry of one who stood guard, and he
said, ‘O my uncle, his Excellency the Bey was within
here a while since, but whether he be still here or be
gone to his own place, enter thou and discover, for I
cannot certify thee.’ So I gave my horse to the boy,
my companion, to hold—a good boy and a useful;
his father is blest in him—and entered in at the gate,
questioning all I met. At last came one who assured
me that the Bey was gone to his dwelling in the city,
and described the house to me and named the quarter
and street in which it stood. So I went back again to
my horse and repeated the description of the house
and its whereabouts to the boy, my companion, who
led me by night ways full of snarling dogs, till we
came to the house.</p>

<p>“From within came sounds of feasting with song
and the voice of the lute. I knocked upon the gate
till there looked forth an old man, to whom I showed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
the letter and its superscription. He went from me,
and came again and told me, saying:</p>

<p>“‘His Honor the Bey makes merry with his
friends. He will not be disturbed. Deign to confide
the letter to me, and I will give it to him in the
morning when he will hear my voice.’</p>

<p>“So, seeing that the man was old and of a kind
countenance, I thought good to give him the letter.</p>

<p>“Then, as I came out from the city, the boy leading
me—for alone I had been as a blind bird in a net—two
soldiers at the gate would have stopped me,
asking my business, and for what cause I rode forth
armed. But the boy slipped past them, and cried to
me, and when they turned to see who cried without,
I put spurs to my horse and galloped by, upsetting
one of them.</p>

<p>“The tale is finished, O my master.”</p>

<p>“Good; I thank thee,” said Shems-ud-dìn, with
dignity. But his soul kept murmuring, “No answer!
He sent no answer!” And its voice was as the sea
for sadness.</p>

<p>Hassan, to cheer him, cried: “Be not downcast,
O light of my eyes! Thy son is young, and the way
of youth to discretion winds through feasting and
carelessness. To-morrow, when he reads thy letter
with a clear mind, he will hasten with joy to meet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
thee. Remember the days that are gone, when thou
also wast light of heart.”</p>

<p>And all they that sat with them in the room joined
with Hassan, saying:</p>

<p>“Thy worthy friend speaks truth. The ways of
youth are not as our ways. The wisdom of youth is
a bird with no nest. Take comfort, O sheykh! Be
assured there is nothing wrong.”</p>

<p>But Shems-ud-dìn derived no comfort from their
sagacity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>

</div>

<p>Next morning, before the start, Shems-ud-dìn
offered money to the lord of the house; but the old
fellâh thrust back his hand.</p>

<p>“Is the honor nothing in thy sight? Give a little
to my neighbors on account of thy companions, and
my peace with thee.”</p>

<p>Shouts of good will went after the departing
guests. Shems-ud-dìn’s heart was lighter than on the
night before. He neared his journey’s end; Alia
seemed no worse; and the shortcomings of Abd-ur-Rahman
appeared excusable by daylight.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from a hilltop, they beheld the city.
Contained in shadowy walls, its roofs clean burnished
by the morning sun, it was a sight to catch the breath.
The Dome of the Rock, three parts shadowed,
bloomed aloof in its noble precinct. Here and there
amid the throng of buildings, some little polished
surface caught the light and flashed, a diamond.
The whole seemed the masterpiece of some worker
in silver or ivory, rather than an old city built at
divers times by men unknown to one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>Of tacit accord the cavalcade had halted to admire,
when a hubbub arose among the Circassians.
Two dead fowls had been discovered beneath the
cloak of Nesìb—fowls stolen from the village they
had just left. Loud were the cries of shame. Hassan
struck the thief on the head with the butt of his
carbine, stunning the wretch, who would have fallen
had not a loving comrade sustained him. He took
the birds and gave them to one more trustworthy, with
orders to return to the village and pay the price of
them.</p>

<p>“Oh, the sin! Oh, the shame of it!” groaned
Shems-ud-dìn.</p>

<p>But Hassan, chancing to overhear, objected,
saying:</p>

<p>“Be not too sad, O my soul! Nesìb is a thief
even as thou art a saint. It is Allah’s will upon him.
He has stolen slippers from the gate of a mosque.
And he has his uses. Not for nothing do I admit an
Arab in my troop. There are but two of them now
among us, Nesìb and one Ali, the friend of Nesìb.
Nesìb would not join without Ali, and Nesìb is so
useful that we accepted Ali, who serves no purpose
on earth, but only hangs upon Nesìb. Ah, our Thief
is clever! He would steal the food out of your
mouth, and your belly none the wiser.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn smiled at the description; and their
talk continued in a pleasant strain till, having crossed
a dry torrent bed in the wady, they began to ascend.</p>

<p>They had lost sight of the city all save the walls,
which ran along the top of the rocks above them.
Shems-ud-dìn’s face fell sad once more, as he mused
upon the mystery of fate, and the uncertainty of what
awaited him up there within.</p>

<p>Lepers and other beggars, seated beside the
broad, made road, howled to them for alms. Men
with donkeys and mules and camels passed up and
down before them. The toll of a mighty bell echoed
among the stony hills—the bell of the Resurrection,
explained Zeyd ebn Abbâs, calling the Nazarenes
to prayer. Everything announced their approach to
a great city such as few of them had seen in all their
lives. Shibli’s excitement knew no bounds. He kept
galloping on in front and returning to tell what he
had seen, asking answerless questions, laughing and
shouting like one possessed.</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop, I say! Are you deaf, all of you?
What do you, wearing arms, so great a company?
Show your teskerehs before I let you pass.”</p>

<p>A soldier stood out before them in the gate of the
city, while two more issued yawning from the guardhouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn proffered his teskereh, but the sentry
scouted it.</p>

<p>“That allows you to travel; good. By what
authority do you travel armed like soldiers?”</p>

<p>“Look hither. Canst read?” said Hassan loftily;
and he held out a copy of that old firmàn naming
him Guardian of the Frontier, which he was in the
habit of carrying about to confute the skeptical.</p>

<p>“What is this?”</p>

<p>“Canst thou not see? It bears the Tûghra, the
handmark of Power.”</p>

<p>“Is it some antique?”</p>

<p>“Dog! Dost scoff at the hand of the Padishah?
Let pass, or thy punishment shall be horrible. Know
that we have with us a greater man than thou ever
sawest in all thy life of sin——”</p>

<p>“Is it this man?” broke in the soldier impudently,
pointing with his finger at Zeyd, the son of
Abbâs, who, on his miserable donkey, in his ragged
clothing, cut the sorriest figure imaginable.</p>

<p>“Pig!” snarled Hassan. “I will ride thee down!”</p>

<p>“Have the kindness only, and thy punishment is
sure. Once in there, thou and thy friends are caught
in a box.”</p>

<p>“Deign but to listen. Knowest thou one Abd-ur-Rahman
Bey, a yezbashi of the garrison?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>“Of course. What is that to thee?”</p>

<p>“I will tell thee. This holy sheykh beside me is
his father. Now let pass.”</p>

<p>“Gently, gently, O my uncle. That is good,
what thou sayest—excellent—I ask no better. Only—I
do not believe it. He of whom thou speakest is
a great one. Everything is known about him; yet I
never heard that he owned a father living, much less
do I look to see his father riding up from nowhere in
the midst of a crew of rascals without proper teskerehs—Ma
sh’ Allah!”</p>

<p>The final exclamation was uttered in a frightened
whisper. The speaker stood back hastily with his
comrades, sprang to attention, and presented arms.</p>

<p>The road described a right angle under the gateway,
so that no one standing without could see
through into the street. The guard had stood for
some seconds rigid, nosing their rifles, ere he whom
they thus honored could be seen of Shems-ud-dìn.
Even then, in the young officer advancing toward
him, one white-gloved hand on his sword hilt, not
running nor manifesting the slightest emotion, he was
slow to recognize his only son.</p>

<p>Abd-ur-Rahman came to his father’s stirrup and
kissed his hand with the same formality which had
marked his approach. He murmured:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>“Welcome, and twice welcome, O my father.”</p>

<p>At sound of his voice a cry went up from within
the litter close at hand; but Abd-ur-Rahman seemed
not to hear it.</p>

<p>“Thou didst receive my letter,” said Shems-ud-dìn,
as they passed in beneath the massive gateway.</p>

<p>Abd-ur-Rahman, still at his stirrup, answered:</p>

<p>“In this hour I received it. It should have been
delivered to me last night, but for the obtuseness of
the doorkeeper at the house where I dwell. As to
thy question concerning Frank physicians, I know
nothing of the matter. I inquired on my way hither,
and have learnt that there exists a hospital kept by
one of them. Thou wilt find its direction written on
this paper, as also that of a khan where thou mayst
find room enough. What was told thee regarding
the present fullness of the city concerns not the Muslim
quarter. I hope that my sister will be soon
healed, and that thou wilt be blest in thy stay here.
Now, with permission, I must leave thee. I will seek
thee after noon at the khan.”</p>

<p>“Allah be with you now and always, O my son.”</p>

<p>As he watched Abd-ur-Rahman stride off down a
side street of many arches, Shems-ud-dìn wondered
what it was that so oppressed his soul.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

</div>

<p>Beneath an arched doorway opening on a tunneled
way where lurked so deep a shadow that, on
emerging thence, the fall of sunlight hurt men’s eyes,
sat a fat old man, greasy and no little dirty, making
his frugal breakfast of bread and olives. Behind
him, through the doorway, basked a little court in
sunlight.</p>

<p>His was the quietest, coolest seat in all El Cûds,
he was used to boast. Great, therefore, was his consternation
when, suddenly deafened with the clatter
of many hoofs, he saw his tunnel invaded by a file
of armed horsemen so numerous that, peeping forth,
he could not see the end of them. At first, being an
infidel, he supposed them sent by government to raid
the hospital and slay every sufferer. But a further
glance convinced him that no such mercy was contemplated.
He perceived a close litter borne between
two mules. The contrivance had entered the tunnel;
it remained to be seen if it would ever get out again.
One called:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>“Hi, O old man! Is this the Frankish hospital?”</p>

<p>“It is a hospital, that is sure. And it is Frankish
in the sense that it is maintained by certain Franks
having more money than wits.”</p>

<p>“There is with us a maiden, very ill. We have
come from far that she may be healed by the Frank
physician. Her nurse is with her in the litter. Let
them in, we beseech thee, to the presence of thy lord.
We bring gifts, and the father of the girl, that sheykh
behind there, is very rich. It will be worth much to
thy lord if he can heal her.”</p>

<p>“Are you Jews?”</p>

<p>“Allah forbid!”</p>

<p>“Is the sufferer of that race?”</p>

<p>“Allah forbid! Why askest thou? Why lookest
thou so strangely? Art thou, perchance, thyself
of the dregs of mankind?”</p>

<p>“What matter for me? I am but the doorkeeper.
But all those who pass within to be healed
or die, as Allah wills, must be Jews and Jews only.
It is the law of the English to whom this house
belongs.”</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah! Knowest thou, O old man, that
this hospital of thine is a place unclean, a place of
sin, no better than a lair of filthy swine?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“I know nothing. I am the doorkeeper. They
pay me monthly wages, and my task is light. I say
they are good people. They can do what they please,
for me.... It is plain you are from the country,
or you would not be surprised and angry at such little
things.”</p>

<p>And he smiled the superior smile of the townsman.</p>

<p>“The physician! Ask concerning the physician.
I would speak to him without delay,” called
Shems-ud-dìn, pushing his way on foot to the
front.</p>

<p>“He will tell you the same which I tell you—only
Jews enter here.... But as for a physician—ah,
I assure you—he is a physician—none like him
under heaven! By Allah, one touch of him cures any
disease less malignant than death itself! Go to his
house, I advise you; it is not far from here. It is
likely he will show mercy to you, for he is a kind
young man. Come, I will teach you the way thither.
I am the doorkeeper, and cannot quit my post. But
perhaps I can find one to guide your honors....
O black man, thou canst never turn those mules in
the alley there. Lead through into the court where
there is room enough. There they can turn at ease,
and the poor, sick lady—may Allah heal her—shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
not be inconvenienced. Take care now! Oäh! Heed
this little step.”</p>

<p>In a trice the old doorkeeper had become all politeness,
espying a silver coin in the hand of Shems-ud-dìn.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the procession stopped once
more before a door, that looked lonely in a place of
high blind walls. By that time it was accompanied
by a crowd of bare-limbed urchins, beggars, and other
idle ones. Zeyd, the son of Abbâs, as riding upon
an ass in the midst of horsemen, and conspicuous for
the wretchedness of his apparel, excited particular admiration
in these adherents. When he got down off
his steed and went to help Mâs unharness the mules
from the litter, they thronged about the despondent
animal, touched and examined it closely, as it had
been of gold.</p>

<p>“Do you covet him, O sons of two walls?” called
Hassan, with his mighty laugh. “His beauty is for
sale, but the price is a high one. Be careful not to
steal him.”</p>

<p>Whereat a grin illumined those dirty faces,
and rows of white teeth gleamed forth. One
of the Circassians hammered loud upon the door
till an old negro looked out in dismay upon their
multitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“Is the physician within? Here is a girl near to
death. We have come from afar, bringing gifts, that
the Frank may heal her.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, he is within. Wait a little while,
till I inform him of your desire.”</p>

<p>The negro shut the door, but reopened it presently
announcing his master’s pleasure to receive
them.</p>

<p>“But not all of you,” was subjoined with a grin.
“It is a house, not a city. Let those concerned enter,
while the rest abide by the beasts.”</p>

<p>“O happy day!” shouted Hassan. “An English
physician is the best of physicians. One in Kars
preserved the life of thousands. Importune him,
pursue him, flatter him; give him no peace till
he hear thee; so shall the girl have life instead of
death.”</p>

<p>Zeyd, the son of Abbâs, Mâs, and two of the
Circassians bore in the litter, taking each a pole.
Through a dim corridor with closed doors on either
hand they passed to an open yard, where, by direction
of the black doorkeeper, they set down their burden
in the sunshine. The pavement of this yard, like the
walls and floor of the entrance passage, was so scrupulously
clean as to seem of white marble, striking
awe into the visitors. Shems-ud-dìn kept close by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
palanquin. A third Circassian followed, both arms
laden with the sheaf of gifts. Hassan, misliking the
looks of the town-bred rabble, stayed without beside
the horses, to keep order; and Shibli, for reasons of
his own, stayed with him, though invited by Shems-ud-dìn
to enter.</p>

<p>The litter deposited in the courtyard of the house,
the three Circassians proceeded, with the help of
Zeyd ebn Abbâs, to spread out the presents upon the
flags so as to be seen to advantage. They were in this
occupation when a Frank emerged from a room above
them and came slowly down a flight of steps into
the court. He was young and of a smiling countenance,
very red, after the manner of his kind when
sunburnt. His eyes were screwed up against the
strong light.</p>

<p>A shout of praise greeted his appearance. All
heads were bowed. Shems-ud-dìn ran to the foot of
the stone flight with design to kiss his hand. But the
Frank resisted. He repaid their salutations fluently,
and, for the rest, spoke in a childish kind of Arabic,
easy to comprehend. He asked to know in what manner
he could serve them.</p>

<p>Zeyd ebn Abbâs and the three Circassians raised
hands and eyes toward the great blue sky, implying
that the gravity of the matter passed human explanation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
and required Allah fitly to describe. Mâs, whose
custom was to mind his own business, employed himself
tranquilly in smoothing down the curtains of the
palanquin. Shems-ud-dìn bowed low before the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Know, O renowned hakìm, that my daughter,
who is here with us, lies sick unto death. And it
was told me in the place where I dwell, how thou canst
heal where all others despair of healing. Wherefore
I journeyed hither under escort of these kind companions,
bringing the girl my daughter, and certain
gifts for thy acceptance, and also a sum of money,
that peradventure thou mightst take pity on my
daughter and condescend to employ thy skill upon her.
O my son, hear the prayer of an old man whose heart
is sad, and I will requite thee to the utmost of my
means, and Allah, who is more than all of us, will
give to thee at the Last Day.”</p>

<p>“Where is the girl?” asked the Frank; and the
abruptness with which he put the question, deigning
no preliminary compliment, caused the bystanders to
say among themselves:</p>

<p>“See how rude he is! He must be conscious of
very great ability to be thus short with the revered
Shems-ud-dìn.”</p>

<p>The physician stooped beside the litter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>“O girl, give me thy hand,” he said; causing
Zeyd and the Circassians to exclaim the more, saying:</p>

<p>“Surely he is a very great physician.”</p>

<p>“Let see thy face.”</p>

<p>At that Alia uttered a faint scream, and a growl
of disapproval came from the four critics.</p>

<p>But Shems-ud-dìn said simply: “Let it be. She
is not yet a woman complete, and Allah knows her
face at present is not such as to excite desire. Be not
afraid, O my dear,” he added in a soothing tone to
the sufferer. “For thy health’s sake, this sacrifice is
required of thee.”</p>

<p>One glance at the unveiled brow sufficed the foreigner.
He rose again quickly and, turning to the
sheykh, shrugged his shoulders with an upward
look.</p>

<p>“How far have you carried her in this manner?”</p>

<p>“Four days or five, O khawâjah.”</p>

<p>For comment the Frank gave another shrug. His
face was troubled. The stare of so many eager eyes
appeared to irk him.</p>

<p>“She is very near to death,” he said at length,
half to himself. “Allah alone can cure her now.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the listeners whispered: “He knows
his trade, this heathen! He makes her case out the
worst possible, in order that his skill in curing her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
may appear the more considerable. Yet is he not
totally without religion, for he ascribes the chief
power to Allah.”</p>

<p>“O sheykh,” pursued the Frank, when he had
withdrawn beyond earshot of the occupants of the
litter, “what can I do? Am I God that thou bringest
to me a dying girl, and sayest, ‘Heal her’?”</p>

<p>Then Shems-ud-dìn adjured him by the love of
Allah, by all things sacred, to have mercy upon Alia,
and not to turn away his face from affliction. He
said:</p>

<p>“If thou refusest, unto whom, under Allah, can
I look for succor? We can but return whence we
came, and my girl will die miserably by the roadside,
for her strength fails her.”</p>

<p>“That is likely,” the physician was forced to
admit; and the thought seemed to pain him. He
frowned and put a hand to his forehead, brushing up
his hair beneath the extraordinary form of headdress
it pleased him to exhibit. “I cannot receive her in
my hospital. It is against the rule, and I am but a
servant there. But there is another hospital. Go
thither.”</p>

<p>Now it was the strength or infirmity of Zeyd ebn
Abbâs, when a spectator, to throw himself into any
business with a zeal and enthusiasm surpassing that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
of the transactors. To him, an excited listener, this
curt recommendation of another hospital seemed the
last word of arrogance. Feeling the call for a supreme
effort at persuasion, he snatched up at haphazard
certain of the gifts which strewed the pavement,
and ran and laid them at the proud one’s feet,
with such earnestness that an earthen pot, which was
among them, cracked upon the stones, releasing a
sticky greenish fluid.</p>

<p>“O pig! O clumsy one! Woe is me. Thou
hast spilt all my honey. May Allah destroy thy
house,” roared one of the Circassians, whose present
it was.</p>

<p>Then the Frank was seen to smile. O triumph!
The Circassians, foremost he whose gift was spoilt,
laughed loud for joy of the victory. The Frank
smiled; his pride relented; the day was won. To the
donor of that honey belonged the glory.</p>

<p>It seemed scarce necessary that the Sheykh
Shems-ud-dìn should continue pleading, demonstrating:</p>

<p>“What know I, O hakìm, of another hospital?
Is it not enough for us, who are honorable men, to
be spurned from the gate of one? Who knows that
at the other they will receive the girl, my daughter?
The one is for Jews only. It is likely the other will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
be found to be for Nazarenes only. Thou art a great
physician, and thy face is kind. Ah, send us not
away! Condescend to treat my child. If she dies,
it is from Allah. Do thou but what is in thy power
to do, and my blessing on thee. I will pay all thou
askest.”</p>

<p>Once more the thoughts of the Frank were seen
to trouble him. He would not meet the piteous gaze
of Shems-ud-dìn, from whose eyes the tears were now
streaming.</p>

<p>“Have you a room?” he asked—“a clean room—very
clean—one to which air comes freely, where
I could visit her daily, and do what I can for her?”</p>

<p>“Merciful Allah! O my son, have I not said
that we are strangers in this city. And a room on this
pattern were hard to find. We purpose to lodge at
a khan beside the Holy Enclosure.”</p>

<p>“A khan! It must not be,” cried the physician,
with more of vehemence than he had hitherto used.
“Rather let her remain with the other woman here
in my house. And do thou, O sheykh, remain here
likewise. As for the others, thy companions, let them
go to the khan.”</p>

<p>“Now may Allah requite thee, O lord of all
kindness!” Shems-ud-dìn raised his tear-stained
face to heaven in thanksgiving. “What man of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
own faith and nation had done as much for me!
May Allah bless thee, exceedingly, and incline thy
mind to receive the truth. Thou hast eased me of
the heaviest of burdens, for in sooth I was at my wits’
end. For myself, I thank thee; I will but stay to see
my beloved at rest ere repairing to the khan. Let
there be no offense, I entreat thee. I am an old man,
O my son, and my habits are a tree above me; I sit
in the shade thereof. Moreover, I am a Muslim,
and thou, O my son, art a Nazarene. That which
seems clean to thee, to me is abomination; and much
that I hold sacred seems dirt to thy mind. Let me
have but free access to my dear, and may Allah increase
thy wealth! Only, I adjure thee, tempt her
not to sin with unclean food, and observe all decency
in regard to her.”</p>

<p>“My doorkeeper is a Muslim. He shall cook
for her, if there be any need of cooking, which I think
not likely. And the woman with her will doubtless
instruct me when I approach her, lest I offend unknowingly.”</p>

<p>“May Allah reward thee.”</p>

<p>It took Zeyd ebn Abbâs time to realize that the
excitement was over. When he did at length grasp
the fact, and his mouth shut from gaping, he did not
retire with the Circassians. These walked backward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
to the entry, shouting blessings on the lord of healing;
but Zeyd ran and kissed the hem of Shems-ud-dìn’s
robe.</p>

<p>“O my master,” he besought, “let me stay by
thee, and go when thou goest. Apart from thee I
walk in darkness, I am lost. Thy companions make
a mock of me.”</p>

<p>“But what of thy donkey?”</p>

<p>“Let it go. Perhaps they will take it to the khan
with the rest. I care not greatly though I lose it, for
it is borrowed.”</p>

<p>To repay the favor shown to him, Zeyd made
himself useful. He helped the servants of the house
prepare a chamber on the upper floor, and, when that
was ready, lent a hand to Mâs and the other negro
in carrying the litter up thither. Though cumbrous
it was no longer heavy, being eased of the weight of
Fatmeh, who now walked beside.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn, alone with Fatmeh, lifted Alia out
on the raised Frankish bed prepared for her. The
physician had long since gone forth upon the business
of his calling. As she sank among the white,
soft cushions, she drew a deep sigh. A Nazarene
handmaid entered the chamber, bearing milk in
a glass, which she offered, saying the master had
ordered it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>When Alia, upheld by her father, had drunk of
it, she licked her lips and fell back upon the pillows.</p>

<p>“Art content?” whispered Shems-ud-dìn, bending
over her.</p>

<p>“It is rest,” she murmured faintly, with closed
eyes.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>

</div>

<p>It was the third hour after noon when Shems-ud-dìn,
by the help of Zeyd ebn Abbâs, made his way
to the khan, whither Shibli and the Circassians had
gone before. Mâs had begged permission to remain
in the house of the Frank, having discovered in the
aged doorkeeper a kindred spirit and compatriot.
And Shems-ud-dìn was glad to leave him within call
of Alia.</p>

<p>At the khan they found two of the Circassians
kicking their heels in the dark entry with the mien
of unwilling idlers. At sight of Shems-ud-dìn their
faces brightened. They asked leave to rejoin their
chief, who, with the rest of his men and young Shibli,
was gone forth to view the city. They had been left
behind only to make report to the sheykh that all was
well, and the beasts safely stabled.</p>

<p>“Is my donkey also safe?” asked Zeyd, with
more of curiosity than concern.</p>

<p>They answered with a grin: “Be sure of it! The
desire of all eyes grinds chaff in the stable here beside
thee.”</p>

<p>There was no one else in the guest chamber when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
Shems-ud-dìn and Zeyd entered. The former took
seat upon the diwàn which ran all round the room,
and the latter soon followed his example, with care,
however, to leave a space between them for reverence.
The place got light through the door only.
The silence was unbroken save for the buzz of many
flies, spasmodical movements on the part of some one
in another room, and an occasional far-off neigh from
the stable. The faintness and seeming distance of
sounds without testified to the thickness of the grimed
old walls.</p>

<p>Zeyd, the son of Abbâs, sat gazing at the stonework
opposite, now and then risking an awe-stricken
glance at his companion’s face, which was downcast
and very sorrowful. When the lord of the khan
came bustling to wish their honors a happy day,
Zeyd laid finger to lip, and checked the tide of civilities.
The host shuffled off again, disappointed and
mystified.</p>

<p>The hue of Shems-ud-dìn’s thoughts was indeed
very somber. He sat in sackcloth, shamefast before
Allah. Where was his faith, his resignation? It
had been lost in his eagerness to win the heart of the
unbeliever to pity Alia. And his present hope, however
faint, was it not an insult to Divine Omnipotence?
His soul cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>“O Lord, I am weak indeed—weaker than I was
aware. Strengthen me in the faith. Make me as
ready to give up as to receive. Hear my cry out of
this shadow, and write not my infirmity against me.”</p>

<p>And Zeyd, sitting near him by the wall, and
gazing furtively upon his face from time to time,
thought:</p>

<p>“Was there ever such a saint? Surely he is holiest
of all men living! Surely angels talk with him,
and the Most High leads him by the hand. O happy
me, to sit unrebuked by the side of such an one, the
companion of his musing!”</p>

<p>They had sat thus in silence a long while, when
footsteps rang without with the noise of something
clanking along the flags. The voice of the host rose
shrill in an ecstacy of salutation. The next minute his
burly form passed the doorway, ushering with profound
salaams a Turkish officer in full uniform.</p>

<p>“His Excellency Abd-ur-Rahman Bey seeks audience
of the illustrious Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn,” he announced
with unction, a perceptible increase of respect
in his tone.</p>

<p>In contrast with his constraint of that morning,
Abd-ur-Rahman came forward now with outstretched
arms and fell on his father’s neck. Zeyd, the son of
Abbâs, stood bowing awhile, but, gaining no notice by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
his mute obeisance, went out to gossip with the lord of
the khan. Abd-ur-Rahman scowled after him.</p>

<p>“Who is that person, O my father?” he asked
with fastidious lips.</p>

<p>“It is a good, poor man, a friend of mine, who
accompanies me for love, not gain, yet waits upon my
needs like a servant. I recommend him to thy favor,
O my son.”</p>

<p>Abd-ur-Rahman laughed, between amusement and
vexation.</p>

<p>“Thou wast ever addicted to strange friendships,
O my father. Remember the begging Hâj who came
years ago to our house and dwelt there many months
in thy love, laughing in his beard. He persuaded thee
without a vestige of proof that he was a Hâfiz and
most pious, while the town without soon knew him for
a drunkard and a cheat, and Hassan Agha drove him
forth at the last. When wilt thou learn to distinguish?
By my head, I would do much to avoid being
seen in the company of him who has just left us; and
lo! thou hast sworn brotherhood with him.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn shook his head archly. “It is plain
to see, O my dear, in what school thou hast studied.
I hear my brother’s voice in every word.”</p>

<p>Abd-ur-Rahman smiled. “That may be. But
say, O my father, wilt thou not take a little thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
for appearances? Out there, in the wilderness, it
matters nothing, for all men know thee. But here, in
the city, it is different. Here men judge of men with
the eyes only; and when one does anything uncommon,
there springs up a talk about it, which is not pleasant.
It distressed me, at our meeting this morning, to behold
thee in so outlandish a company. They are good,
faithful men, and our friends, that is known. And
perhaps any one of them, seen separately, might pass
unheeded. But all together.... As well cry aloud
in the market! Already the tale of your arrival is
noised abroad; and the mouth of rumor is a dirty
fountain; it adds something foul to what it utters.
Men speak of thee as a madman, of thy companions
as mockers at thy madness. They say that
thou hast left thy daughter, my sister, in the power
of a certain Frank, a man unmarried and but lately
come to the city, of whom nothing is known. Surely
that is an idle tale, O my father?”</p>

<p>“It is truth, though the wrong side thereof. Thy
sister is not alone. Fatmeh and Mâs are beside her
in that house. Moreover, I have gazed on the face
of the Frank, and found it a good face. They assure
me he is a clever physician. It is enough.”</p>

<p>“Verily thou hast a talent for liking strange
beasts. At the least, O my father, go not abroad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
with our Circassian friends in a body as you rode to-day.
The tongue of the city defames and sullies; and
I, thy son, enjoy some standing here, and a name not
unrespected.”</p>

<p>“In all which I hear plainly the voice of my
brother Milhem—the dear one. How is his health
in these days?”</p>

<p>“He is well, the praise to Allah! In everyone of
his letters he charges me with some fond message unto
thee, O my father.”</p>

<p>“How comes it that I have received none of
them? Why hast thou not written to me these many
months? Is there any dearth of travelers in our
direction that thou couldst not send me word by one
of them?”</p>

<p>The young Bey hung his head, examining the hilt
of his sword as though there had been something
amiss with it. He stammered:</p>

<p>“Since I came to this city, I have been very busy
acquiring proficiency in my new duties. And in the
evening, when I have leisure, I am weary; and to
write, unless by daylight, hurts my eyes. I have
sinned, O my father.”</p>

<p>“I forgive and bless thee. But, ah me! how like
thou growest to my brother Milhem.” The sheykh
put hand to forehead and indulged his memory a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
little space. Then, turning sharply to his son, “Thou
hast not asked concerning the health of Alia.”</p>

<p>“How is her condition?” said Abd-ur-Rahman
promptly.</p>

<p>“Praise Allah for the kindness of that Frankish
doctor.... Thou wilt come to-morrow and visit
her in his house?”</p>

<p>Abd-ur-Rahman shook his head and smiled deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“That may scarcely be, O my father. My position
in El Cûds is one of some prominence. I dare
not invite scandal by entering a house of unbelief;
about which, in connection with thee and thy friends,
there is talk enough already.... Tell me, O my
father, why dost thou take so much trouble on account
of the illness of my sister? Wouldst thou have done
as much for the health of me, thy son? It is said that
thou hast promised half thy fortune to this Frank.
And yet a man is held of more account than a girl.
They dub thee madman, O my father. I love not to
hear such insolent talk of thee.”</p>

<p>“Thou canst always smite the mouth of the
speaker,” began Shems-ud-dìn, indignant. But before
he could proceed, heavy footsteps sounded in the
entry, and Hassan burst in.</p>

<p>“O my eyes, I have seen two Bedawis of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
same band which we passed yesterday upon the road.
They were prowling near the castle, entering into conversation
with the soldiers. By Allah, I know their
business at the Feast of the Nazarenes. They would
steal rifles——”</p>

<p>“Ah, of a truth, would they?” said Abd-ur-Rahman
dryly.</p>

<p>“Ha, is it thou, Abd-ur-Rahman, O child of my
soul? By Allah, in the dimness I mistook thy form
for that of our glorious Zeyd ebn Abbâs. A mercy
thou didst speak. How is thy health, O beloved? In
sh’ Allah, it is the best possible. Thou art come,
doubtless, to rejoice with thy father. There is no
longer any fear for Alia. She is safe in the care of an
English physician.”</p>

<p>“I must depart,” said the Bey soon after, when
more footsteps echoed without. “Be not wroth with
me, O my father, if during the course of thy sojourn
here I shall appear sometimes neglectful. Thou
knowest not how fettered is the life of one in authority.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn accompanied his son as far as the
outer portal of the khan, a low arch open on a narrow
shadowed way. Overhead, above the square-cut
roofs, the sky was flushed with sunset. At parting,
Shems-ud-dìn took the lad’s face between his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
two hands and, looking straight into his eyes, said
quietly:</p>

<p>“Of a truth, in speech and manner thou art
grown the very marrow of my brother Milhem. He
could never perceive the ground of my doings. My
heart is sad at present—very sad; so I entreat thee
not to vex my understanding with every idle rumor
which may wound thy vanity. I am answerable to
none save Allah for my madness. Now go thy way,
and may Allah keep thee always.”</p>

<p>With that he kissed his son between the eyebrows
and let him go.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>

</div>

<p>The sun rode high above the Holy City, but a
freshness of the dawn still lurked in the shade of her
rough walls, in the gloom of her covered ways, which
swarmed with people in all kinds of raiment representative
of every nation under heaven. To anyone
threading that crowded labyrinth of whitish stone,
ancient and coherent, glimpses of the pure blue sky
became welcome as a flower on rocks. For Shems-ud-dìn,
accustomed through so many years to wide horizons
and an open road, the overshadowing walls
made a prison. The hubbub of the bazaars dazed
him, and he felt hurt by the careless shouldering of
other wayfarers.</p>

<p>He had been to visit Alia, and was making his
way, under guidance of the faithful Zeyd, to the Sacred
Area, when he met Shibli walking with Hassan
Agha and his attendant Circassians amid the throng
in a long, dim market.</p>

<p>“How is the health of our dove this morning?”
cried Hassan, speaking for them all. “In sh’ Allah,
the poor one is much better?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“If not better, her frame has rest—for which
Allah be praised!” returned Shems-ud-dìn. “The
people of the house are very kind, as I learn from the
mouth of Mâs. The Lord reward them!... O
Shibli, son of my hope, unless thou hast some grave
business, come with me to the Dome of the Rock,
whither I go to pray. It is long since I spoke with
thee in private. Come and let thy voice comfort me,
O my dear.”</p>

<p>Shibli obeyed, as in duty bound; but his face often
turned to gaze wistfully after the Circassians, and the
lines of his mouth expressed grievance.</p>

<p>“Is the health of the beloved indeed no better?”
he felt it incumbent on him to ask.</p>

<p>“I know not how to answer thee, O my son. I
fear hope as a friend untried. It is enough to desire.
Notwithstanding, if Allah wills that she be made
whole, there appears to my mind a possibility which
yesterday I could not discern.”</p>

<p>“Praise be to Allah!” murmured Shibli very
properly.</p>

<p>The quiet of the Muslim quarter brought refreshment
to Shems-ud-dìn, after the clamor of the motley
throng in the bazaars. Old walls rose high on either
hand. Jutting lattices, with here and there an arch,
encroached on the jewel sky. In the shade of one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
ancient portal, ornate but crumbling to decay, sat a
breadseller asleep behind two tiers of flat, brown
loaves. A man with a water skin on his back turned
in at the doorway of a house before them. A grave
notable, in apparel sober but rich, passed them without
a glance, one hand in his breast. Everything in
that dim, once splendid quarter told of a proud reserve,
of a dignity that needs no trump for its assertion.
The air was sad with the sadness of great
things past.</p>

<p>They entered what seemed a disused bazaar of
rare magnificence, a huge corridor with a lofty vaulted
roof, which got light from the far end where its tall
arch framed the sky. The place was deserted and
ruinous, its floor uneven and strewn with the brash of
masonry. Shems-ud-dìn quickened step instinctively
to gain the light which picked out the faces of his
companions from the shades wherein they had walked
so long.</p>

<p>The outer sunshine crashed on their sight with
the splinter of a thousand lances. The great mouth
of the passage yawned black as night behind them.
On either side of it ran a high irregular wall, bearing
here and there a lattice, the end of the houses in this
direction. They stood on a strip of clear ground, on
which a few old trees cast blots of shadow; a place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
waste, save for patches of wrought pavement and
certain small, domed shrines as delicate as toys of
ivory.</p>

<p>Before them, at no great distance, rose a flight of
wide steps leading up on to a terraced plateau, and at
a point farther off up sprang a sister flight exactly similar.
On the top of either stairway, in the gate of the
Haràm, stood three slender columns, light and graceful
as flower stems, supporting arches. At one end of
the plateau, seen through cypress trees, crouched a
mosque of many aisles; and numberless small, domed
buildings—shrines and cells and pulpits—capped the
terrace walls. But what drew and absorbed their
gaze to the forgetting of all else, the sun and center
of all, was a mighty dome, in form and color somewhat
resembling a ripe fig, springing from the roof
of an octagon of two kinds of marble, wrought together
into cunning patterns. Not a foot of the great
building but had been treated minutely, curiously, by
the hands of forgotten craftsmen. In the full light
of morning, there in that sand-hued place, it bloomed
a wondrous iris of the hills, a thing to wring a shout
from the dying.</p>

<p>Even Shibli forgot his dudgeon, and joined reverently
with Zeyd ebn Abbâs in reciting the prayer of
first approach, after Shems-ud-dìn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>Then, having gazed all about them, they crossed
the waste ground and mounted the steps. Discarding
slippers, they passed along a time-worn pavement to
the place of washing. With the exception of two
middle-aged men in dark robes and white turbans,
who sat disputing gravely beneath a tree and gave but
one look to the pilgrims, they seemed alone in the
vast inclosure.</p>

<p>When, having purified their bodies, they ventured
to approach the Noble Sanctuary, Shems-ud-dìn
thought well to remind them of its claims to reverence.</p>

<p>“Within, beneath this admirable dome,” he said,
“we shall behold the rock whereon Neby Ibrahìm,
the Friend of God, prepared to sacrifice his beloved
son Ismaìl, at the bidding of the Most High. Hither
also, in an after age, was our lord Muhammed, the
Apostle of God, borne by night on the celestial beast,
Burac; and from that same rock was he transported
to the seventh heaven, being yet mortal. Surely there
is no stone in all the world, save only that of Mekka,
more worthy of our reverence than this rock, which
God has hallowed from of old. And the Khalif,
Omar El Khattab (peace to him), did well to raise
this splendid dome above it.”</p>

<p>Zeyd ebn Abbâs devoured those high words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
greedily. Shibli heard them with respect. At the
entrance to the Dome of the Rock, Shems-ud-dìn
ceased speaking, and they passed into the tinted gloom
of the sanctuary.</p>

<p>While Shibli and Zeyd ebn Abbâs paced the ring
of pavement, studying the texts worked in mosaic
upon the walls and above the arches, looking on the
natural rock so gloriously enshrined, Shems-ud-dìn
knelt and made prostration, praying:</p>

<p>“O Allah, pardon! Grant to thy servant faith
on the pattern of El Khalìl, who in this place offered
his dearest freely unto thee. Am I not the very opposite
of Neby Ibrahìm El Khalìl? When all reasonable
means failed to restore my child, and prayer had
been made in vain, Thy Will was manifest to me.
Yet I presumed to seek other aid, I sought to procure
her health by man’s exertion. I followed the contrivance
of my own mind. Am I not impious, therefore?
Am I not abominable? What am I that Thou
shouldst hear me, or my deeds upon the earth to make
a claim upon Thee? Nevertheless, Thou deignest to
give ear to the prayers of men, and hast ordained
prayer unto us as an offering pleasing in Thy sight.
Hear me, O Lord, in this my extremity! Oh, have
mercy on my daughter, the innocent; and smite me
rather, for I am sinful! And whatever Thy Will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
concerning her, teach me to resign myself to it utterly.
Subdue my mind and my soul, and lead me in the way
of the upright.”</p>

<p>He rose at length from off the pavement, and
went and sat crosslegged, his back against the wall.
Tears blinded him. The footsteps of Shibli and Zeyd
echoed in the vast dome, and their whispering made
a hollow murmur. But Shems-ud-dìn heard nothing
save the clamor of his inward strife.</p>

<p>All at once a voice near his ear said, “Why weepest
thou, O my brother?”</p>

<p>With a start, as one awakes out of sleep, he
looked and beheld one in flowing raiment standing
before him, a very old man who leaned upon a staff.
His face was deeply furrowed where the white hair
grew not, and his lips were shriveled and sucked inward
as when the gums beneath have shrunken, being
toothless. Shems-ud-dìn sat amazed by the apparition,
for he had not heard the old man’s steps approaching
nor the tap of his staff along the stones.
He saw the forms of Zeyd and Shibli afar off, standing
watching as men smitten with dismay.</p>

<p>“What ails thee, O my brother? Wherefore
weepest thou? I cannot discern thy likeness, for my
eyes grow dim; but I see thy beard white as my own,
and I hear thy sobs. What dire distress is thine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
an old man inured to human griefs, that thou so
lamentest?”</p>

<p>“A long story, O my brother.”</p>

<p>“A long story is the best of stories, and I like it
none the worse for promising to be sad. At my age
one is impatient only of abruptness, the inconsequence
of the merry and light-minded. Lend me the help of
thy hand, O my brother, that I may compose my limbs
to sit beside thee.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn reached forth his hand and the old
man grasped it, steadying himself therewith while he
tucked his staff beneath his left elbow. He was about
to subside upon the bare stones, when Zeyd ebn Abbâs
darted forward and spread his ragged cloak upon the
ground beneath him. The old man smiled vaguely,
exposing his toothless gums.</p>

<p>“May Allah requite thee, O my son! May this
thy courtesy be counted to thee for righteousness!
Thy cloak is old and of poor material, as my hands
perceive. May a rich mantle fall upon thee from the
hand of Allah!”</p>

<p>Zeyd bowed his head to the blessing, and rejoined
Shibli with a face of great elation.</p>

<p>“Now deign to impart thy story, O my brother!”
said the old man, when fairly seated.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn complied straightway. He abated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
nothing of his own frowardness, but confessed it
throughout the story, speaking much of his soul’s uneasiness
on that account.</p>

<p>At the end, there was silence for a little space.
Then that old man spoke:</p>

<p>“During all the years that I have been Chief of
the Learned in this place, never—Allah witness!—never
heard I such a tale as this thou hast related.
Beloved, I see not with thy eyes; I see goodness everywhere
in thy conduct, save only in the one point of thy
recourse to the unbeliever, of which thou madest
naught in the telling. This Frank is not an infidel like
another infidel. He is of those who openly oppose
the faith. Is there not a korân concerning such an
one: ‘The worst beasts in God’s sight are those who
are obstinate unbelievers’?”</p>

<p>“But, on the other hand, there is also this korân:
‘Allah is our Lord and your Lord; unto us our
works, and unto you your works; no quarreling between
us and you; for Allah will gather in us both,
and unto Him we shall return.’”</p>

<p>“Good. But that word is abrogated in the judgment
of all the learned!”</p>

<p>“Not of all, by thy leave! There be many who
assert that no word from Allah can be rendered null,
that this has its season, and that its season, but all are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
eternally valid. I was ever of the party of these last.
As to the degree of intercourse permissible with unbelievers,
and more especially with the People of the
Book, it is nowhere fixed for us. I could quote a hundred
traditions in support of either argument, and the
best precedents are in like manner at variance. For
instance, if we refer to the Sûnna——”</p>

<p>“Stay! Hast thou studied the Sûnna?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly; and all our commentators and, I
verily believe, every scripture relevant to the subject.”</p>

<p>“O happy day for me! Welcome, and again welcome,
O my soul! Deign now to dispute a little! It
is seldom I can exercise my learning; very seldom I
am able to confer with a man like thee. The lamp of
knowledge does but smoke nowadays.”</p>

<p>It was long since Shems-ud-dìn had enjoyed conversation
with his equal in learning. The two
sheykhs held long conference, while Zeyd sat on his
heels watching them, and Shibli wandered to and fro,
yawning frequently and viewing the wonders about
him with a growing disenchantment.</p>

<p>At last the old man rose by the help of Shems-ud-dìn
and the attentive Zeyd. He said:</p>

<p>“My peace on thee! Thou art a prince of scholars,
and a man most righteous. If I perceive any
fault in thee, it is that thy mind exalts small matters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
and overlooks or belittles points of real importance—a
common failing among us learned in the Law, professed
quibblers. This matter of thy going to the
Frank is, to my thinking, no trifle. I hope to convince
thee of the wrong in it at some other time. Come
hither whenever thou art so minded; it is a boon I
crave of thee. Ask for Mahmûd Ali, which is my
name. And if ever thou desirest to pray alone, there
stand cells enough within our precincts, empty, for the
most part, save in Ramadan, which is not yet. They
and all I dispose of are thine to use, O my soul’s
brother!”</p>

<p>With a parting benison the old man hobbled
away, bowed upon his staff.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn said one last prayer, then went out
with his companions into the blinding sunlight.</p>

<p>Zeyd, the son of Abbâs, raised his hands on high,
toward that sapphire dome which has the world for
pavement. In a loud voice he praised Allah, and
blessed the day on which it had been given him to witness
the meeting of two most holy men, and garner
in his imagination a drop or two of the celestial wisdom
that had gushed in rivers from their mouths.</p>

<p>Shibli drew breath of relief, and looked upon the
heaped-up, whitish city with a lover’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Come, O my brothers! Talk is vain when the
throat is dry and the belly empty. Lead the way to
some place where we can eat together, and drink a cup
or two of good coffee. So shall our business prosper
by the blessing of Allah.”</p>

<p>“But we have no money, O my lord! How
should we soldiers have money, seeing they never
pay us?”</p>

<p>“With me is money enough. Deign to eat and
drink at my expense, and mine the honor.”</p>

<p>“May Allah Most High repay your noble Excellency!”</p>

<p>Two soldiers of a rank somewhat above the private,
accosted by Hassan Agha amid the crowd in a
long bazaar, laid hand to breast and lip and brow,
bowing to his invitation as men too greatly honored.
Their tongues still wagged of reluctance and unworthiness
even while their feet made speed toward
the place of refreshment. Three Circassians, the companions
of Hassan’s morning prowl, followed intelligently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
like trained hounds. Shibli went along with
them, mystified yet admiring.</p>

<p>The tavern to which they came was chill and dark
within. They carried their stools to the wide entrance,
where they could enjoy the relative warmth
and light of the street without.</p>

<p>“Arac, O lord of good cheer! Bring to us
arac!” cried the soldiers.</p>

<p>“Allah forbid!” murmured Shibli with a start,
gazing in horror at those reckless ones. He knew
only that they called for a fiery drink and maddening,
accounted poison by all faithful men.</p>

<p>Thereupon the whole company burst out laughing,
and the tavern keeper, attendant on their needs,
laughed with them, holding his belly.</p>

<p>“Allah forgive our ribaldry!” said Hassan.
“The sin is ours, not his. Know, O my brothers, that
this is a good, virtuous youth, the disciple of a certain
holy one revered of all. Allah witness, and do thou
take note, O Shibli, that I, for my part, touch not the
abomination. Neither I nor my companions; let it be
told the sheykh!” He turned then to the soldiers,
adding, “It behooves a man to avoid small offenses
when he has the uncommon honor to be the friend and
companion of the holiest of living men. And that
honor is upon all of us here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>The soldiers expressed their polite interest in
tones of commiseration. To sip their arac without
reproach, they had taken seat close to a pillar of the
doorway which screened them, when they leant to
drink, from the gaze of the passer-by.</p>

<p>“Once, when I was a boy,” said one of them, entertaining
Shibli and the rest, while his colleague
spoke aside with Hassan, “I had the honor to lie
down beneath the horse of a holy sheykh—I and my
father and my big brother and a thousand more.
It was in El Bica’a, behind Lebanon. The plain was
strewn with living bodies. You could not see the
ground anywhere between us. Then the sheykh rode
his horse over the backs of us, and when it came to my
back, lo, it was to me no more than if some girl, mistress
of beauty, fondled me for love, there where the
hoof pressed. And the spot has been blessed ever
since; for when I do evil it pains me, and when I do
good it is again as if some hand of love caressed me.
By Allah, it pains me now for the sake of this arac—a
sin, as the youth rightly declared!... A strange
thing—not so, O my masters?</p>

<p>“I remember to have seen, in Anadol far from
here, a man who went well-nigh naked, his face like
the earth itself for dirt and roughness. A one-eyed
man might see that he was holy above the rest of us.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
That man leaned upon a sword—upon the blade of
it, by Allah! so that the point came forth at his back.
Then he drew it out slowly, showing all men how the
blood rained from it. As for him, he laughed to see
the red stuff fall. Then, as we looked for him to die,
he began to dance, chanting praise to Allah. And
that he did not once nor twice, but many times before
he died. Strange things are seen in the world, O my
masters! By Allah, I count you fortunate! I myself
would fain behold that saint of yours. Peradventure
he would grant me to witness some marvel
worth relating, like the turning of wicked people
into dogs....”</p>

<p>“The Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn is no wandering derwìsh,
whose mind is to cajole the vulgar,” broke in
Shibli, from the height of indignation. “He is a
learned sheykh of the religion, a man of high lineage
and great wealth, to whose wisdom even princes defer
with reverence.”</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah!” smiled the soldier, but little
impressed. “Your talk had led me to suppose
him otherwise. Why call him saint, then? Has
he wrought no signs in the land?”</p>

<p>“Of a truth, that has he, by Allah,” said Hassan,
who had ended his whispered conference. “He
brought light to the city where we dwell. He is lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
of the jân. They have had no master like him since
the death of Suleyman the Wise. When his daughter
fell ill, and all help failed, it was by advice of a
jinni, his slave, that he brought her hither, to this city,
to the house of a Frank physician, where she now lies.
Signs, say you? I assure you, by Allah, he is lord of
them all! He knows the language of beasts, and on
our way hither made use of that knowledge to restore
to a certain poor fellâh his camel, which
had been long lost. The fellâh, his name Zeyd
ebn Abbâs, is still with us. If thou wilt, thou canst
speak with him and hear the wondrous story from
his own lips.”</p>

<p>“Is it truth thou speakest?” asked one of the
soldiers, with a shrug aside to his mate.</p>

<p>“By Allah, it is truth! All these are witnesses
with me. Ask one of them. Ask any man acquainted
with his holiness!”</p>

<p>They sat a-row in the wide archway, brushed by
the raiment of the throng without, hearing snatches
of conversation, shouts, laughter, and the ceaseless
shuffle of feet along the stones; while at their backs
was darkness, save for one red gleam of fire, which
the ample form of the taverner kept eclipsing as it
revolved in his avocations about the brazier.</p>

<p>“Allah knows I should count it an honor to behold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
that saint of yours,” said one of the soldiers at
length, in a manner of resolution.</p>

<p>“And I also,” agreed the other in the same tone
of belated conviction.</p>

<p>“That is easy. If Allah will, we shall find him
without difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Let us go, then!”</p>

<p>“Slowly, slowly, O my two dear ones!” Hassan’s
face turned cunning in the mold of thought.
“Is our business settled quite? No, I think not so.
We have not yet appointed an hour for the transaction.
Let it be after to-morrow, toward the fifth
hour of night. What say you?”</p>

<p>The soldiers shook their heads.</p>

<p>“No,” said each, upon reflection. “After to-morrow
is the great feast of the Nazarenes—of half
of them, that is to say; for the two halves quarrel so
that they cannot even keep festival upon the same
day.... It is the busiest of the year for us. We
shall stop their fighting in the church; and after that,
it is likely, we shall be called upon to keep order in
the streets of the city. It is work enough for one day.
Let our business stand over till the night beyond.”</p>

<p>“As you will,” said Hassan, playing indifference.
“But I would have the goods as soon as possible. My
eyes have perceived certain rascals in the garb of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
Bedawi prowling near the castle and whispering with
you soldiers. Now, I adjure you, face the matter!
View it fairly with clean eyes! Are we not—my men
and I—loyal servants of the Sultàn appointed from
of old to guard the Eastern portals of this land, and
so entitled to arms and ammunition like you others?
As for the Bedû, what are they? Marauders, thieves,
murderers—Allah knows them! It were a crime to
give them the preference!”</p>

<p>The soldiers exchanged sly glances, swift as sword
thrusts. Said one of them, cringing, “What sayest
thou, O Excellency? The Bedû!... Allah pity!
What Bedû?”</p>

<p>“Perchance,” thrust in the other with an air of
extreme candor, “our good lord would allude to certain
tribesmen who, calling themselves Catholics, are
come up to fight at the feast.”</p>

<p>Hassan laughed. “Think not I trust you. Remember
only that, in the place where I dwell, it is
counted death to offend Hassan Agha.... And
now, unless your desire is changed, we will show you
the saint of whom we talked but now.”</p>

<p>“With joy and alacrity,” replied the soldiers.</p>

<p>All, rising, kicked back their stools. They smiled
one to another, showing white teeth, as they yawned
and stretched themselves. Hassan told some small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
gleaming coins into the grimed hand of the taverner,
thrust out in anticipation from the inner
gloom.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a muttered exclamation not of
blessing, the soldiers dodged behind the stone doorpost.
The hindmost, upsetting a stool, cursed its religion
as it fell. In the covered way without, they had
seen a young officer riding upon a black horse, slowly,
because of the crowd. It was Abd-ur-Rahman Bey.</p>

<p>Hassan Agha stood forward with a jaunty air, a
hand on his white mustache.</p>

<p>“Hail, O sun of soldiery! May thy day be
happy, O child of a blessed birth! Deign to dismount
and drink one cup of coffee with him who first
taught thee to handle sword and gun!”</p>

<p>His design in thus shouting before the multitude
was simply to vex the false pride of the son of Shems-ud-dìn.
It amazed him to have his salutation returned
twofold, to see the proud youth alight and
give his horse to a bystander.</p>

<p>“How is thy health, O Hassan, light of my
eyes?” inquired Abd-ur-Rahman, smiling, as they
touched hands. “And thou, O Shibli: is all well with
thee?... How is Alia? How the dear old man?”</p>

<p>He chose for seat one of those stools which the
soldiers had just vacated, next to that which was overturned.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
Straightway he became aware of a shuffling
close at hand, and, looking round the doorpost, beheld
two of his own men.</p>

<p>“What is this, O Muhammed—O Rashìd?”
he asked, smiling. “Is my face this morning so terrible
that you must hide from it? Come forth, O
foolish ones, and attend me to the castle, whither I go
presently.... O Hassan, a word with thee in private,
by thy leave!”</p>

<p>He carried his stool into the inner gloom, and
Hassan followed him. They conversed apart until
the coffee was served, when they brought back their
stools into the light of the doorway. Hassan reappeared
frowning, but the countenance of the young
caïd beamed, as before, of an imperturbable good
humor.</p>

<p>Abd-ur-Rahman stayed but to swallow a cupful of
coffee; then rose, smiling on the company, and took
leave. The two soldiers followed him with the demeanor
of whipped curs. They went forward to offer
him assistance at mounting his horse, and he availed
himself of their obsequiousness, still smiling.</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah,” muttered Hassan, as he watched
them depart. “To reflect that it is but a youth, one
whom yesterday I held upon my knee. By the Lord
of Heaven and Earth, he is a devil!... That is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
not the son of the Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn! It is the son
of Milhem Pasha, Eblìs in person——!”</p>

<p>As they sauntered forth in search of the sheykh,
he continued:</p>

<p>“May it please you, he forbids us to touch a
rifle. He says that he will apply to the authorities
on our behalf for a special grant. The praise to
Allah! We shall wait a hundred years and see never
a cartridge! Our need is instant, and if we get not
the things, others less worthy will presently obtain
them. I know these outlying garrisons. At Istanbûl
or Edreyneh it may be different. But for Esh-Shâm,
El Cûds, Haleb, there is one way in all of them.”</p>

<p>He ceased not to growl in soliloquy.</p>

<p>They had entered a narrow alley of the Muslim
quarter, strolling as their manner was, when there
came a sound of feet hurrying after, and a ragged
soldier overtook them, sweating and out of breath.</p>

<p>“Say, is not one among you the excellent Hassan
Agha, whom Allah preserve?”</p>

<p>“I am he.”</p>

<p>The man louted. “A word from the Bimbashi
Muhammed—he that had charge of the armory
(Allah witness how I ran to overtake thee, questioning
all men as I ran; for I had but a hint of thy likeness
and the number of thy companions from him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
who sent me)—a word from the Bimbashi Muhammed
which he whispered to me in the castle yard as
he went to durance: ‘Attempt nothing, for the love
of Allah! Lay aside thy purpose. For things are
not as of wont.’”</p>

<p>“Good. I thank thee.” Hassan bestowed on
the man a coin and received his blessing in exchange.
He appeared unmoved by the tidings.</p>

<p>“The day wears on,” he said. “Let us go at
once to the sheykh, for I am impatient to hear his
news.”</p>

<p>“At this hour we shall find him in the Haràm,”
asserted Shibli, who was supposed to know.</p>

<p>Toward the sanctuary they went accordingly. It
had thundered in the night; the day had dawned in
rain, and so continued until the third hour. But now
the clouds were rolled away to eastward. As the
little group emerged from the buried ways of the
city on to the open ground below the shrine, Omar’s
dome was a dew-drenched flower in the sunlight, the
scattered cypress trees pricked a sky of dreamy blue.</p>

<p>At the top of the steps, along the edge of the
noble terrace, rose divers little cubic buildings like
to tombs. Their open arches gave the effect of
mouths gaping on the central dome.</p>

<p>On the threshold of one of those alcoves, gazing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
raptly in, squatted Zeyd, the son of Abbâs. The
fellâh laid a finger to his lip at their approach.</p>

<p>“Hush!” he whispered and pointed. There, in
the white recess, sat Shems-ud-dìn, stiffly rocking to
and fro, his face set, his eyes steadfastly downcast.
“The health of the girl is worse to-day. She knew
him not. Let Allah comfort him!”</p>

<p>All murmured of compassion and reverence.
Shibli threw himself down beside Zeyd, in the same
shadow with his master. The rest sat on their heels
in the sunshine, enjoying that sight of holiness.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>

</div>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn now divided his days between the
house of the physician and that tomblike cell; and
the two scenes overlapped and obscured one another,
becoming confounded in his imagination. In those
days his thoughts but brushed our earth as with the
skirt of an outer robe. The Angels of Life and
Death were his elect companions. When, repairing
at nightfall to the khan, he descried known faces,
met the outcry of condolence, it was with the blindness
of a sun gazer, with the deafness of one long
a stranger to men’s talk.</p>

<p>Yet, even in the deep of anguish there were moments
when he saw and heard; and those moments
showered gold in the lap of Zeyd ebn Abbâs, his dog-like
attendant. They repaid the hours which the
whilom owner of a playful camel had spent in silence
at his feet; the times when, unthanked, unperceived,
Zeyd had guided his master’s steps through the
crowd.</p>

<p>These brief communings with his lord, which
were all the wages of Zeyd, took place generally at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
the cell on the edge of the close, where Shems-ud-dìn
seemed most content. The fellâh too loved that
spot above all others of the city. Squatting in the
sunshine of that holy place, near by a world-famed
shrine, himself the guardian of a saint, he was conscious
of laying up a store of sanctity, of pious memories,
to sustain him through the rest of life. When
the aged Mahmûd Ali came, as often happened, to
observe and bemoan the sad case of a fellow-sage,
he never failed to bless Zeyd and praise his fidelity.
So that that simple man cried in his soul:</p>

<p>“How great my happiness! Behold, I grow
daily in goodness, without effort, even as flowers
grow, through converse with such holy ones. They
scorn me not as do the Circassians, who, therefore,
it is well seen, are but low people.”</p>

<p>At the house of the Frank physician, while Shems-ud-dìn
remained in the sick room, Zeyd was accustomed
to sit with Mâs and Ismaìl the doorkeeper in
the little court. But the two old negroes were not
instructive; their happiness consisted in holding one
another’s hand and smiling foolishly. Zeyd’s mind,
apt to wander from such converse, hung in danger
from the charms of a barefaced serving woman, who
kept crossing and recrossing the court—of set purpose,
he supposed, to entice him. Only by the mercy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
of Allah did he escape the daily snare of her. As
the companion of a great saint, he had taken the
pilgrim’s vow of total abstinence.</p>

<p>On an evening when Zeyd sat thus resisting temptation
in the company of old Mâs (the doorkeeper
having gone forth to drink the air and display a new
garment, gift of the Frank his master), Shems-ud-dìn
came down from the place of sickness, showing a
countenance far brighter than he was wont to bear.</p>

<p>The two arose and, bowing, put their question;
to which he replied:</p>

<p>“The praise to Allah! This morning I dared
not rejoice, but this evening, seeing the improvement
still maintained, I render thanks to God. Come, O
Zeyd, O Mâs, walk with me a little in the streets of
the city. Let us view the much merchandise and the
throng of men, for my soul is glad within me.”</p>

<p>Upon that Mâs, seeing his master’s soul at ease,
ventured upon a petition he had long borne it in his
mind to make. Stooping, he touched the hem of
Shems-ud-dìn’s robe, then kissed the hand which had
touched it. He exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Deign to hear me, O my lord! I ask a favor—a
small thing, far beneath thee. There dwell here
in the city many poor men, servants, black like me.
These meet together privately to be judged of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
sheykh, who is no other than Ismaìl, the doorkeeper
at this house. They seek the right, but as the street
dogs seek, whom no man stoops to feed. Their
prayer is through me unto thee, O my master, that
thou wilt grant them a little instruction. This is the
Day of Assembly, when they meet always toward
sunset. Vouchsafe to honor them, and I, thy slave,
will guide thee to the place.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure and alacrity,” replied Shems-ud-dìn,
and the teeth of the negro gleamed forth in
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Forthwith, at his accustomed mooning pace, Mâs
set about his preparations. From out a vault, whereof
the door stood open, he produced a lantern, which
he opened to be sure the candle was not spent. He
put a box of Frankish matches within the frame, shut
to the glass, and, taking a staff that leaned against
the wall, smiled of readiness.</p>

<p>Zeyd, with Shems-ud-dìn, followed him out into
the streets, where forms moved vaguely in rich lights
and shadows, like the concourse of a dream.</p>

<p>Zeyd raised his eyes to the sky, a blue eye of love
perusing the sun-red city, and his thoughts were a
lump in his throat. At length men recognized the
holiness of the Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn; at last they
cried to him for light. Surely Allah had smitten the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
multitude with blindness; certainly the notables of
this city, her merchants, her high officials were as
blind as their own walls. Allah had put out their
eyes, as He had put out those of Hassan Agha the
iniquitous and his crew of reprobates. It had been
reserved for a poor fellâh, for a few low negroes, to
perceive and welcome the blessing from on high.</p>

<p>They crossed the open space before the tower,
where was noise and much people, shadows in an
amber glow, and thence passed by dim and quiet
ways through the Armenian quarter. Here and
there, along the coping of old walls, the leaves of
stone plants burned like tongues of flame. A gate
yawned on them suddenly, its square tower red in the
stream of sunset. It let them out on to the brink of
a gorge full of dusty gloom.</p>

<p>Mâs kept to the top of the rocks, close along by
the foot of the wall. Following, through deep shadows,
Zeyd in mind compared himself to one proved
faithful passing, by support of the Prophet, over the
hair bridge into Paradise. Between black wall and
blue abyss, their path ran, a very thread. The
ravines seemed fathomless. The high hills were of
the sky, all warmth. The features of the landscape
were transfigured, exaggerated, made monstrous with
excess of color like an opium dream. Yet though he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
felt as one poised in mid-air, Zeyd knew no fear; having
with him the saint, that enchanter whose mere
neighborhood made a seer of the poor fellâh.</p>

<p>At a turn of the wall, Mâs waited for them to
overtake him. There a wide prospect was revealed.
Far away, across a darkling sea of ridge and gully,
stood a pile all rosy in the sun’s last rays. It was the
rampart of their own wild land, which frowns at
dawn upon the Sea of Lot. Shems-ud-dìn stood
still to gaze upon that distant splendor. But Mâs
plucked his robe.</p>

<p>“Behold the assembly, O my master!”</p>

<p>The stretch of embattled wall seemed of iron,
bounding a hearth of colored fires. It cast such
gloom upon the rocks, that Zeyd must look twice ere
he discerned the white of turbans and men’s raiment
near at hand.</p>

<p>“Great honor is on all of you!” cried Mâs, as
he moved on. A group of men, set in circle upon a
grass-clad crown of rock beneath the wall, rose as
one and did obeisance with words of blessing.</p>

<p>“Pursue your business, I entreat you,” said
Shems-ud-dìn graciously, taking seat with them.
“Let not my presence trouble you. I would listen
awhile before I speak.”</p>

<p>After some polite demur, the blacks resumed their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
conference; and Shems-ud-dìn listened with interest,
but the mind of Zeyd turned again to the contemplation
of its own blessedness.</p>

<p>One of the circle, who was called the Pearl,
told with much childish lamentation how he had been
wrongfully accused of theft, and beaten by his master.
“I know well the thief,” he blubbered. “And
my back is sore. I would see him punished. Is it
right that I inform my master?”</p>

<p>Then their head, that was the doorkeeper of the
Frank physician, stroked his beard and answered
thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“To steal is not good. Where I was born, they
cut off the right hand of him who steals. But here
it is otherwise. Here be many thieves, very wicked
men.... Inform not against thy fellow-servant,
now that thy trial is past. In the moment of pain it
had been well enough to name him. Thou art young,
O Pearl, and strong, none like thee. Take that thief
apart, and beat him even as thou wast beaten, that
he sin no more.”</p>

<p>When the negroes ceased to praise God for that
wise judgment, another cause was brought forward.
But Zeyd heard no more. Watching the blush fade
upon those distant heights, the wall of his own land,
he sat entranced by the mystery of being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>The buzz of voices ceased. He heard as if in
a dream the voice of Ismaìl say:</p>

<p>“Deign now to instruct us, O master!”</p>

<p>“It is I who have received instruction, O thou
Locman of this age,” replied Shems-ud-dìn; and the
tones of his voice unclosed Zeyd’s consciousness, like
the sun’s touch on a flower. “Allah is with you simple
ones. Verily the mercy of Allah is the free spring
of the poor.”</p>

<p>And he continued speaking of the mercy of Allah
in such splendid terms that Zeyd caught fire at them
and seemed inspired, he also crying: “Hear him!”
“O Allah!” “O Lord!” “His mouth is gold!”
“Praise to Allah!” “I faint!” “I die!” moaning
and sighing gustily like one possessed.</p>

<p>The end of the speech was for Zeyd like a dazed
awakening. He saw the negroes rise, a dark mass,
and heard them praise Allah for that grand discourse.
Then he saw Mâs with the lantern lighted,
and thereby knew that it was night and time to move.</p>

<p>The light danced and wavered before him, a
thing unreal. They were back in the heart of the
city ere he knew they had passed the gate. Mâs and
the sheykh of the negroes stalked on ahead, the lantern
between them. Zeyd himself followed close
upon Shems-ud-dìn. All at once he remembered that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
they were going now to the khan, to the companions,
and a sudden jealousy inflamed him.</p>

<p>He said, “O my master, where is the youth
Shibli, thy disciple? This day makes the second
that he has not been near thee. He grows bad
with the Circassians, who set their minds to corrupt
him.”</p>

<p>“Hassan Agha has much business. And it is
natural that Shibli should desire to see the city in
his company.”</p>

<p>“And thy son. May Allah guard me from begetting
one like him. Since the day of our arrival he
has not once visited thee.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless he has been at the khan in my
absence.”</p>

<p>“Not so, for I have made inquiry.”</p>

<p>“He has his duties, and the pleasures of his age.
He is young, I am old. In distress I ask no company
save thine, O kind one!”</p>

<p>“May Allah requite thee, O my dear lord!”</p>

<p>At the house of the Frank, Shems-ud-dìn entered
with the negroes for the purpose of complimenting
the physician upon the improvement wrought in Alia.
After a very little while he rejoined Zeyd, who at
once felt a change in his demeanor.</p>

<p>“What is there new, O my master?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“The hakìm, that excellent man, assures me that
my daughter cannot live.”</p>

<p>Zeyd laughed, a short and angry laugh. “Is he
then Allah?” he asked scornfully.</p>

<p>But Shems-ud-dìn no longer heard him.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

</div>

<p>“Thy son—since the first day he has not visited
thee. Allah guard me from begetting one like him.”</p>

<p>The reproach of Zeyd, scarce heeded at the moment,
linked Shems-ud-dìn’s reveries on the morrow
of its utterance, recurring often like a sad refrain.
It prevented his submersion in that stupor of prayerful
musing which was his comfort. Yet not until
noon was past, and the shadow of the gracious dome
drew out to eastward, did it hold the foreground of
his thought.</p>

<p>The aged Mahmûd Ali had come to sit with him
awhile, and was reciting words of comfort in the high
mosque voice, when Shems-ud-dìn asked himself,
Was Abd-ur-Rahman all to blame? Had not the
father likewise a duty toward the son? To be sure
that his mind did not err, he said presently to the
aged sheykh, his comforter:</p>

<p>“O my brother, hear a case and pronounce on it.
A certain man had offspring a son and daughter,
those two only, both dear to him. Yet did the balance
of his love incline toward the daughter. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
day he appeared to slight the boy, making much
of the girl. And the boy was angry and drew
away from him. Was the right with the son or
the father? Upon which of them two rests the
obligation?”</p>

<p>Zeyd, the son of Abbâs, on his heels out in the
sunlight, emitted an “Ah!” of breathless interest.
The aged Mahmûd Ali stroked his beard, reflecting.
At length he replied:</p>

<p>“There is right with both of them, and against
both. But the higher right is with the son. For did
not his father reverse the ordinance of God by setting
the woman above the man? Less is expected
from a woman, it is for that she should receive less.
I perceive that the case is thine. Is the son with thee
in this city?”</p>

<p>“Let the case be a case like another,” said Shems-ud-dìn,
unwilling to betray his son’s name.</p>

<p>Zeyd moaned. “It is too much for me. My
blessedness is become a pain in my side. Surely never
till now was man, poor and ignorant like me, privileged
to hear such wisdom.”</p>

<p>The verdict of the Chief of the Learned removed
all hesitation from the mind of Shems-ud-dìn. Accordingly,
about the fourth hour after noon, some
time before he was wont to repair to the side of Alia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
he entered the streets of the city, and bade Zeyd discover
the whereabouts of the Bey’s lodging. In this
they experienced no difficulty, everyone consulted
making haste to direct them with reverence for the
callers on so great a man. Zeyd, finding his beggarly
appearance overlooked, grew less rigid in dislike of
a youth whose name had so genial an influence. Still
it was with relief, on arrival at their destination, that
he heard the doorkeeper inform his master that the
Bey was out, and unlikely to return ere night.</p>

<p>The tidings cast down Shems-ud-dìn. Made aimless
by disappointment, he wandered in the streets.
Zeyd followed unobtrusively, his shadow always.
The disciple was racking his brain for an array of
words fine and imposing enough to comfort one
so accomplished, when, in passing the entrance of a
tavern, Shems-ud-dìn happened to glance therein.</p>

<p>“Praise to Allah!” he exclaimed suddenly.
“Behold him there. He is found.” And he turned
in beneath the low arch, Zeyd at his heels.</p>

<p>The vault within struck dark and very cool. It
was empty save for the proprietor (a portly Nazarene)
and a group of three Turkish officers set on
stools round a small table. Of these, two seemed
sons of an Arab; but the fez of the third and eldest
sealed the face of a Frank. The eyes of this last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
were blue, his cheeks ruddy, his mustache had the
color of ripe wheat.</p>

<p>At Shems-ud-dìn’s glad cry the three turned
startled faces. Only one rose up in response to his
salutation, and that was Abd-ur-Rahman. The
other two kept their seats, staring aghast at the
intrusion. And Abd-ur-Rahman did not rush to
embrace his father, but hung back, the picture of
irresolution.</p>

<p>Blind to this reluctance, Shems-ud-dìn took a stool
beside his son, while Zeyd crossed his legs upon the
ground hard by.</p>

<p>“I come to reproach thee a little, O my dear!
Why hast thou failed my soul these many days when
I need thy love for a staff? Thou hast shown no
concern for Alia, who often cries for thee. It is not
kind, O beloved!”</p>

<p>“O my eyes, I have so much business. Ask of
these, my companions, and they will certify thee.”</p>

<p>“Ah, by Allah, business enough to kill ten yoke
of oxen, yet we survive somehow,” affirmed he of the
red face mockingly. “Drink something, old man.
With me the money.”</p>

<p>“May thy wealth increase; I am not thirsty,”
said Shems-ud-dìn stiffly, disliking the man’s tone.
“What is that thou drinkest, O my son? It must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
precious as attar of roses to be served in so small a
glass. Doubtless it is some sherbet new to me. The
caterers invent fresh kinds from year to year.”</p>

<p>Abd-ur-Rahman muttered unintelligibly. He
had done all man could to conceal his glass.</p>

<p>“That is it, by Allah,” laughed the two others.
“A new sherbet. Taste and judge of its composition,
O my uncle.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, no.” Shems-ud-dìn drew back
from the glass thrust on him. He began to resent
the manner of these youths. Why did not Abd-ur-Rahman
restrain their insolence? He looked to his
son in indignant appeal, but the lad’s face was turned
away, his attitude helpless.</p>

<p>“Then shall the valiant emìr, thy companion,
taste thereof. Come, O Commander of the Faithful.
Ennoble this little glass.”</p>

<p>Zeyd, the son of Abbâs, took the glass held out to
him, sniffed at the liquor, and then poured it out upon
the ground.</p>

<p>“It is accursed, a sin for any man. Let the dirt
drink it,” he said coolly.</p>

<p>At that the jokers laughed immoderately.</p>

<p>“Thou dog!” cried he of the straw mustache,
whose drink it was that was spilt. “Thou hast
wasted a day’s wage of one like thee. Thank Allah<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
that I beat thee not until thou clog thy belly with
the dirt it soaks.”</p>

<p>But Abd-ur-Rahman joined not in their laughter.
He kept his face averted from his father, and his
whole pose announced such perfect wretchedness that
Shems-ud-dìn, feeling concern for him, touched his
arm, asking:</p>

<p>“What hurts thee, O my son?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. There is nothing,” came the answer
like a moan.</p>

<p>“It is this new sherbet,” roared the other two.
“It cools, and he has drunk too much of it. It has
iced his belly. Fear not, O my uncle. He has a girl—ah,
a beauty! who will expel the evil for him.”</p>

<p>At that, perceiving they made game of him, the
Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn arose with dignity.</p>

<p>“Allah shall teach you with punishment. Your
own fathers are dishonored in that you respect not my
beard and turban,” he said; and without further words
strode forth into the street, followed with alacrity by
Zeyd, the son of Abbâs.</p>

<p>The tavern keeper, seeing customers driven forth
before they had ordered anything, ran after and entreated
them to remain and honor him. In low tones
he apologized for the rudeness of the young officers.</p>

<p>“They have no manners, they respect nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
The others are bad enough, but that Nemsâwi is the
lord of mischief. Before now he has broken my chattels
without so much as a blessing. He pays for nothing.
Keep it not against me, O my lords, but return
and taste of something. Ennoble my poor place.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn walked on, leaving him to groan
and wring his hands upon the threshold.</p>

<p>The jeers of the young men accompanied the
departure. But Abd-ur-Rahman neither spoke nor
moved. The last Zeyd saw of him, his face was
buried in his hands.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

</div>

<p>Deprived of the counsel of Shems-ud-dìn, demoralized
by confinement within walls, the little
band of Circassians loitered in the markets with a
sense of grievance. The sight of so many heathen—Franks
and Nazarenes and unclean Jews—disgusted
them in the city; and when they rode out
to exercise their horses, the need to return went
with them, killing pleasure, like the clank of a
heavy chain.</p>

<p>At the end of ten days squandered in El Cûds,
Hassan Agha was further from obtaining his rifles
than he had been at first passing the gate. The soldiers
avoided him; it seemed they had their orders.
Abd-ur-Rahman, though smiling when they met in the
street, steadfastly refused him audience. On the
fourteenth day he faced the stern necessity, if they
were to stay much longer in that money-eating place,
of selling one of the lovely steeds which were their
glory.</p>

<p>In a certain tavern he cast lots with his men, whose
horse should go; and the lot fell upon Nesìb the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
Thief, who straightway lifted up his voice and wept.
Yet even he preferred the sacrifice to a shameful retreat,
as though worsted by the boy Abd-ur-Rahman,
while their beloved saint and his daughter, sole pretext
of their coming, still abode in the city. They had
taken it for granted beforehand that the cure of Alia
by the wizard would be instantaneous, a mere wave
of the hand, and resented its slowness as a deceit of
the heathen dog.</p>

<p>Yet they were restrained from ventilating this
grievance, and so easing their minds, by a captious
whim of Hassan’s to uphold the Frankish pig.</p>

<p>“He is an English physician. If Allah permits,
he will perform his part,” was the answer to their
grumblings.</p>

<p>“What change is this, O lord Hassan!” cried
one, thus repressed. “Is an Englishman other than
a Frank, a vile infidel? Did they not deliver our land
to the Muscovite, even while they touched our hands
in friendship? How often hast thou denounced the
whole brood of them?”</p>

<p>“Be silent!” Hassan commanded. “Taken
separately they are good people—none better—brave
and the slingstone of their word, but put together in
the nation, they are treacherous as loose stones. Individuals
of that race strove bravely with us against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
the Muscovite, while their nation betrayed them and
us. It was commonly known in those days that this
kind have neither honor nor nobility except when cut
off. A strange people. Now this hakìm is cut off;
he stands alone. Let be then, he will perform his
covenant.”</p>

<p>“In sh’ Allah!” the band murmured, but this
stopper on expression of their just annoyance only
caused it to ferment.</p>

<p>In the temper to quarrel with their own shadows
and kill whoever brushed against them, it was only by
the courtesy or the cowardice of other wayfarers that
they escaped embroilment. Even as it was, on two
occasions their conduct called for the interference of
the street watch.</p>

<p>In the wide open space before the tower, where
fellahìn from Beyt-Laham and the surrounding villages
stand to sell the produce of their fields, they one
morning encountered Ismaìl, the doorkeeper of the
Frank physician, going marketing, a basket on his
arm.</p>

<p>Instantly Nesìb the Thief went mad, or so it
seemed to his companions. Like a fierce dog, he flew
snarling at the throat of the old negro.</p>

<p>“Pig! Whence hast thou that garment?”</p>

<p>“It is the gift of my master.” The tall black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
grinned as with a sweep of his long gnarled arm he
flung off his assailant.</p>

<p>At that the fury of Nesìb passed all bounds. He
drew the dagger from his waistband and sprang
again, this time foaming at the mouth.</p>

<p>Again the strength of the negro felled him easily.
But, seeing the old man’s wrist bled from a scratch
of the knife, Hassan Agha intervened. He dealt the
Thief a cuff under the ear which sent him staggering
up against a wall near by; and did the like for Ali,
the bosom friend of the Thief, who had the rashness
to cry shame on the blow.</p>

<p>By that time many people gathered toward them;
and, spying soldiers, Shibli took to his heels.</p>

<p>“Cut his life! Burn his house! O Allah! O
Lord!” raved Nesìb. “Is it not enough to lose my
horse? The black pig wears my honor—O defilement!
that princely garment. May his father perish!
An heirloom in my family! Woe on us! I gave it
to the Frank hakìm, and the black pig wears it.
Oo—oo!”</p>

<p>The watch came and demanded to know the
meaning of the disturbance. Hassan simply shrugged
his shoulders and directed their gaze upon the maniac
scrabbling at the wall. He said:</p>

<p>“It is a poor friend of mine who has had so many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
and great misfortunes in a short time that, see, his
mind is broken.”</p>

<p>“The poor one. May Allah relieve him!” said
the soldiers piously, and went their way. On their
departure, Hassan gripped the Thief by the shoulders,
and shook him till his tongue lolled out.</p>

<p>“Allah grant thy parents a shameful death! Be
silent! What is this garment to lament—some mohair—a
little braid?”</p>

<p>“It is an ancient garment—a most reverend garment—all
my inheritance!” gasped the sufferer.</p>

<p>At that, past patience, Hassan seized his ears as
they had been two handles, and, heedless of the
shrieks of Ali, beat his head against the wall, saying:</p>

<p>“Speak no more of it! It was given from thee,
not so? So the hakìm cure the daughter of Shems-ud-dìn,
what matter who wears it? It has served its
turn.”</p>

<p>And Nesìb, dreading further punishment, fell
silent, weeping upon Ali’s breast.</p>

<p>Their second brawl was of a more public nature.
It chanced, on an afternoon when the Nazarenes had
a great ceremony in their church called the Resurrection,
that Hassan and his men, attended as usual by
Shibli, passed by the mouth of the bazaar leading
down to the church, at an hour when the throng of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
worshipers poured forth. They were shouldering
their way through that herd of infidels, when some
men made resistance, pushing hard against them.
Peering about him angrily, Hassan saw shawled heads
and swarthy faces with eyes of smoldering fire.</p>

<p>“O happy day! May Allah destroy every Bedawi!”
He spat in the face of the nearest.</p>

<p>In the twinkling of an eye there was a fray.
Knives flashed, blood was drawn. Piercing screams
of Frankish women came from the crowd around.
The breath of each combatant was hot in the face of
his antagonist, at such close quarters was the strife.
One fell and was trampled under foot; another
shrieked and threw up his hands, but was caught by
a comrade.</p>

<p>All at once rang out a voice of command. The
guard returning from the church had surrounded
them in the nick of time. The struggle ceased magically.
The soldiers, inured to such work, separated
the two factions neatly without partiality or insult.</p>

<p>“It is a vengeance for blood,” cried Hassan.
“These dogs slew my two sons. They have paid no
indemnity. My cause is just!”</p>

<p>“He is a liar; hear him not, O my lord! We
know not him nor his sons.”</p>

<p>“It is a blood feud; let them alone, O my children,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
said the officer in command of the detachment,
a man advanced in years. “Drive the one party back
toward the church, the other on toward the tower,
that they be fairly sundered.... When thou, O
old wolf, next requirest the price of blood, see thou
choose some spot more seemly than the heart of the
city. Is there not land enough open in all the world
that thou must needs choose this place?”</p>

<p>“Art hurt, my son?” asked Hassan of Shibli, as
they were driven toward the tower.</p>

<p>“Aye, and that sorely,” replied the young man,
nursing his two hands. “I had slain him who smote
me, but that he escaped in the crowd.”</p>

<p>“I smote thee, O valorous youth,” laughed one
at his side. “Thou didst clasp me so tight from
behind that I was hampered, so I pricked thy two
hands.”</p>

<p>At that there was loud laughter, and Shibli hung
his head.</p>

<p>“That soldier spoke sense,” observed Hassan
later, when, freed from surveillance, they were returning
to the khan. “Outside the walls is best for
battle as for everything else. Thy horse is preserved
to thee, O Thief. To-morrow, or the day after, we
retire from the city. It is good at least to know that
those Bedû are not favored above us. They have not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
procured rifles, or would they still be here among the
jumpers of walls? By Allah’s leave, we may chance
on their camping ground and make an end. At least,
if Allah will, we can glean a little, out of sight of the
garrison.”</p>

<p>“We shall have all the wealth of the land, I
swear it, so only that I keep my horse,” cried the
Thief in rapture.</p>

<p>It was with enthusiasm that all to whom Hassan
spoke on the morrow heard of his decision to quit the
city. His open abuse of a government which could
refuse a few rifles to men worn out in its service, had
alarmed the timorous and supple townsmen. He had
inveighed against Abd-ur-Rahman Bey, a young man
of the first influence, in terms almost treasonable, calling
him selfish and impious, a dog who pushed back
the gift of an old friend, and was above speaking to
his own father. Sober men frown on such talk, and
a certain rich merchant, overhearing some of it, had
observed:</p>

<p>“These men are possessed with blind devils. Is
it to be supposed that Abd-ur-Rahman will show them
kindness when they defame him in the markets? And
can he now let them take the rifles? I will give you
my neighbor’s hoard privately, as between ourselves;
but blab the matter beforehand, and I avert my face,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
I draw my robe away, I have no knowledge of you.
As for what the old braggart says about Abd-ur-Rahman’s
father, it is a lie. Abd-ur-Rahman is an
orphan, both of father and mother. I have the assurance
of it from his own mouth.”</p>

<p>That merchant, with the other tavern haunters,
was aware how often men who hear sedition and rebuke
not its prophet, are themselves made guilty of
it in the eve of Power. And Hassan, in the midst
of his adherents, looked ill to rebuke. The coffee
sellers, therefore, joined with their customers in extolling
the wisdom of his plan to depart. They
praised his intelligence, and that of his honorable
companions. The city was no place for them. It was
a malicious place, a backbiting and slanderous place,
the home of all injustice. No wonder their Excellencies
preferred the open land; and so on.</p>

<p>Hassan, the dupe of these plaudits, was returning
in great satisfaction from his morning round, when
he saw from a distance a man beckoning to him beside
the doorway of the khan. Drawing near, he
recognized the Bimbashi Muhammed. “Ma sh’
Allah!” he exclaimed in his soul; for he had thought
never again to behold that particular rascal.</p>

<p>“Deign to step apart with me,” said the soldier,
with lowly reverence; and, when Hassan had complied,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
he touched his uniform piteously, calling attention
to a change in it. “See, I have been degraded.
I have suffered much for thy sake. Thou wilt not
give up the undertaking, surely—thou, a great one—for
the fee is like owing to me for all I have endured.
I come to tell thee that vigilance is relaxed, that all is
now favorable to our business—but to learn from the
lord of the khan that your honors depart in the morning.
Go not far away, O my dear! Return by night
to the city. I will warn the guards at the city gate;
I myself will admit thee to the tower. I cannot bring
you the things because of a sacred oath which was
wrung from me. But I can open the door of the armory.
Fear not, O my master. There is no danger,
Allah witness. At the fourth hour of the night. And
the fee—we agreed upon that. Forget not the fee, O
my eyes, for I have suffered much.”</p>

<p>Once more he touched his mutilated uniform in
the manner of a beggar showing sores. Hassan
pulled his white mustache, and eyed the man grimly
askance.</p>

<p>“It is not good to deceive Hassan Agha.”</p>

<p>The poor soldier flung up his hands. “Allah witness,”
he cried, in tones of real horror. “O my great
lord, trust Muhammed. I am a poor honest man
whose one aim is to serve thee and obtain the reward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“Agreed then,” said Hassan, well content.
“To-morrow, at the fourth hour of the night, be
ready. With my peace, go.”</p>

<p>Muhammed blessed him and went. His tone
throughout, though cringing, had been straightforward,
without a trace of that conscious subtlety which
had disfigured his behavior upon former occasions.
It was the manner of a merchant who, seeing his customer
in act to depart, through fear of losing him,
speaks truth for the first time.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>

</div>

<p>It was close upon sunrise when Hassan Agha and
his men threaded the burrows of the city to the northern
gate. Few moved abroad beside themselves.
Dogs slunk drowsily along by the walls, seeking lairs
for the day. Once past the gate and its stretching
shadow, they all with one accord clapped spurs to
their horses.</p>

<p>Away they galloped, shouting, through olive
groves where the sunrise reddened one side of the
knotty trunks, and awoke a pearly sheen in the gray
mistlike foliage. Past old rock tombs, past caverns
fledged with fern, they dashed in the pink of morning.
From an eminence, the city walls appeared a blue
cloud line just beneath the sun. The rays smote their
shoulders with a loving hand. They were free.</p>

<p>Shibli rode with them by indulgence of the Sheykh
Shems-ud-dìn, before whom they had laid their plan
overnight. The saint had heard them listlessly, as
from a distance. He had approved of everything
with the slight impatience of one in haste to be rid of
questions. But not so Zeyd, the son of Abbâs. Sure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
that they were bent on some iniquity, the fellâh had
done all in the power of grimaces and private signals
to arouse misgiving in his master, all in vain; till at
length, with a shrug for an obtuseness which he knew
for the God-sent rind of sanctity, he accepted the inevitable.
Executing a circular bow to comprise all
the enemy, he had besought them to brighten once
again the village of his wife’s sister’s husband’s uncle,
who, poor good man, would thus be rendered the
happiest of living creatures. When Hassan welcomed
the suggestion, Zeyd had praised Allah as for
a favor done to himself. He looked to harvest from
the lips of his distant relative such clear evidence of
their wickedness as should convince even a saint’s incredulity.</p>

<p>But Hassan was not going to seek that village
until the evening. He wished to celebrate the release
from entombing walls by a day’s ride in quest of
adventure.</p>

<p>Letting the horses resume a quiet pace, they joked
and chatted together, while the land led them onward
by waves. At length, from between some ancient
olive trees which watched a sea of corn, they beheld
a flat-roofed village with three upper chambers like
towers projecting above the herd of dwellings.</p>

<p>“There, in sh’ Allah, we will break our fast,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
said Hassan, to the joy of Shibli, who, from excessive
delight in the ride, was very hungry.</p>

<p>At the foot of a little height the village crowned,
were women fetching water from the spring. Their
pitchers filled, they stood to gossip, with arms akimbo.
On beholding a crowd of riders, they huddled together
in alarm. Other women, at work in the field hard by,
stood up to stare at the strangers. A man with a preposterous
turban came forth from the village, yawning,
with arms upraised. He had begun to descend
toward the spring, when he, too, caught sight of the
horsemen, and stood still beneath a young fig tree, his
hand shading his eyes.</p>

<p>“We be soldiers,” shouted Hassan, loud enough
to be heard of the man in the distance. “O women,
conduct us to the house of your sheykh.”</p>

<p>At that the women raised a wail, and wrung their
hands. The man by the fig tree ran back whence
he came.</p>

<p>“O Allah, have mercy. What have our men
worth requiring? O my lords, there is nothing left
with us. All our beasts are dead lately of a murrain.
A blight is on our crops these many years.”</p>

<p>“Draw near, O rising moon,” said Hassan,
ogling the youngest and most lissome of the group.
“Fear not, O delight. It is but a drink from thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
pitcher. O mothers of mighty men, give to drink to
my companions. We are not wild beasts to devour
you. Why so afraid?”</p>

<p>A moment they hung in a flutter. Then the girl,
enticed of Hassan, took a bold step forward, giggling
at her companions. She held up her pitcher.
Having drunk his fill, Hassan hugged her in his arms.
She gave but a little scream and struggled faintly, giggling.
Louder screams and laughter came from the
elder women, caught in like manner. The toilers in
the field applauded the pretty game.</p>

<p>“By Allah, my old mouth waters. My soul is
sick for desire of thee,” said Hassan, with the pant of
love. “For the sake of all you women—how beautiful!
how seductive!—we will spare this village. Say
I not well, O my children? We will ask no more of
the sheykh than to make for us a little feast to confirm
friendship. My peace on you.”</p>

<p>At that the girl who had served Hassan set off,
running with rhythmic hips, the pitcher poised upon
her head. Before the horsemen reached the house of
the sheykh, she had convoked all the men of the place
to do them honor. Impressed by her breathless,
eager tale, those villagers were ready to make a holiday,
to roast a sheep, and gorge thereon till night, to
spit a dozen fowls, to boil a hill of rice. But Hassan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
magnanimously bade them spare their pains. He
asked only bread and curds, a few olives, a cup of
coffee, for himself and each of his following. The
crowd lost speech in wonder at his moderation. His
frugal needs were at once supplied.</p>

<p>When he and all his company were satisfied, the
villagers led them forth with praise upon their way.
At the foot of a rocky slope they said farewell.</p>

<p>“What is the name of yonder shrine?” asked
Hassan, pointing with his hand to a mountain, on
the summit of which, up against the sky, appeared the
form of a wely or saint’s tomb.</p>

<p>“His name is Neby Samwìl, may it please your
Excellency,” the reply was given by a score of voices.</p>

<p>“Is it a great shrine?”</p>

<p>The villagers shrugged shoulders, and smiled
widely, glancing at one another. It was as his Excellency
pleased. Some pilgrims went there.</p>

<p>The cavalcade rode on by rough and stony ways,
while the sun on their backs shone hot and hotter.
Wild flowers grew in beds between the rocks. Now
and then a bird cried. The hues of earth in contrast
with the deep blue sky were pale and dead, as sands
beside the sea. A train of camels, pursuing some
other road, appeared and disappeared, mere dots
upon the sky line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>Coming in sight of another village, hardly separate
from its surrounding rocks, Hassan called the
Thief to his side and gave some orders, heard of
Shibli, who rode near. “Take one other with thee,”
were the concluding words.</p>

<p>“Let me be that one,” pleaded Shibli eagerly.</p>

<p>“Thou, the scholar, the disciple of the Sheykh
Shems-ud-dìn. Allah forbid!”</p>

<p>“Nay, let me. I would show you all that I am
not a coward. And in truth, since the girl Alia is
in the way of recovery, I care not what becomes
of me.”</p>

<p>“Go, then,” said Hassan, between a grin and a
sneer. “And see that thou support our Thief properly,
else Ali, his friend, will surely beat thee.”</p>

<p>Shibli dropped behind with Nesìb, while Hassan
and the rest of the party rode on in earnest conference.</p>

<p>At entering the village, Ali, the only Arab left to
them, cried aloud by Hassan’s orders, so that all who
rested from the heat looked forth at their doors:</p>

<p>“O good people, O pious Muslimûn, come out
and see. Lo! here be pilgrims of distinction—holy
men, none like them—men of renown. They come
from Jebel Câf, that mountain reaching into heaven,
which is the boundary of the whole earth. From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
Jebel Câf, I say, to visit your Neby Samwìl, the illustrious,
the blessed. It is an honor done to all your
land. Come forth and behold that which no poor
man ever yet was privileged to see—princes from
Jebel Câf, which is under heaven.”</p>

<p>And when all the inhabitants stood gaping in their
doorways:</p>

<p>“Come forth,” he cried, “beyond the houses.
Let all see and hear alike. This place is too narrow.”</p>

<p>Then, having lured them out into the open, Ali
there addressed them at great length; bidding them
be good ever more, and sin never again, for that they
were now ennobled above all their fathers, having
beheld the kings of Jebel Câf, the very Gate of
Heaven, who come once in a thousand years. Their
crops would increase thenceforth; all provisions in
their houses would abound miraculously. In the end,
he besought Hassan to bless them, and then rode off,
leaving them perfectly bewildered.</p>

<p>Scarcely were they out of sight of those simpletons,
when they espied Shibli and the Thief seated
under a rock beside the path, holding their steeds by
the headropes.</p>

<p>“It was the work of a minute,” cried Shibli, much
excited. “We have many useful things, but alas! no
money. Nesìb has ten fowls which he caught and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
bagged before I could have laid hand on one of them.
Also, he changed some things from house to house, so
that those fellahìn may suspect one another of the
theft. He is a devil, this Thief. I had been naught
without him.”</p>

<p>Hassan looked hard at the speaker. “The praise
to Allah,” he said, “we have now two thieves instead
of one.”</p>

<p>The boy’s eyes flashed with anger, and his lips
parted to make answer. The next minute his eyes
swam in tears, and he hung his head, silenced. For
long he spoke no word to anyone, but rode apart in
dudgeon or despondency.</p>

<p>They came to a wady trending eastward athwart
their road. A fairly defined goat path ran along its
hither bank. Saying they had gone far enough in a
straight line from the city, Hassan led the way upon
that narrow track, the rest following him in single file.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far in the new direction
ere their leader reined up. The track was gone. But
the sharp eyes of Nesìb made out a village in the distance
where they could be sure of learning the way.
Hassan resigned the post of leader to the Thief, himself
riding second in the file. He could thus converse
with Nesìb without fear of being overheard.</p>

<p>“We have no money,” he said savagely. “Look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
to it that we obtain some before evening. How can
we enter the Tower, how fee the soldiers, without
money? I myself will help thee, if thou fearest a
bold stroke.”</p>

<p>“No money.” Nesìb’s shoulders went up to his
ears on the shrug of despair. “I will do what is possible,
O my dear lord! But money is not like fowls,
nor yet like flowers by the wayside. Allah witness, I
can neither catch nor pluck it. I know not beforehand
where it lies. It must come to my hand, or I
cannot take it. Allah put it near me, since our need is
urgent.”</p>

<p>At the entering in of the village Nesìb had spied
from afar, grew a fine tree, beneath which, at the hour
of their approach, lay two sturdy youths asleep.
These being awakened, one of them gladly undertook
to guide their honors to a place whence the road ran
clear to El Cûds. For half an hour he led them in
and out among the stony hills till, near a village superior
in size and structure to any they had yet seen,
he set them on a wide track and pointed out their direction.
Receiving some small coins for his services,
he cried on Allah to increase their wealth.</p>

<p>“May Allah heed him,” muttered Hassan, “for
he has our last dinâr.”</p>

<p>The sun was still high when they learnt from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
some other wayfarers that they were again near to
the city and within a short hour of the village of
Zeyd’s relation. Hassan bade Shibli and the rest go
on thither, while he and Nesìb attended to some business
they had to transact in common. With laughter
and knowing looks, the troop rode off.</p>

<p>Hassan and the Thief urged their horses up a
small, steep hill, from the top of which they beheld
the city, and much country on all hands. Beneath
them in the dale they had just left were many olive
trees a-shimmer in the sun, which cast a filigree of
shade upon the field and on the bridle path which
wound among them. Having secured their horses out
of sight, they sat to watch that path.</p>

<p>At last, when from long watching he had dropped
to sleep, old Hassan was aroused by an exclamation
from the Thief at his side. He presently became
aware of figures moving upon the path, drawing near
out of the distance.</p>

<p>He perceived a fat man bestriding a tall black
jackass, and beside him a servant, walking, holding a
sunshade over the fat one’s head. The donkey bore
full saddlebags, to judge from the angle of projection
of his rider’s legs. And the fat man kept clutching
the bosom of his robe, as if that, too, were not
empty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>“Come, O my lord. Let us descend,” hissed
Nesìb. “Yon old man has our money. Watch his
hands; observe his glance of fear to every side.
Y’Allah!”</p>

<p>They stole rapidly down the hill, making use of
every scrap of cover. Long before the fat man and
his servant reached the place of their descent, two
simple men, an old and a young, sat by the roadside,
beneath a wall that fenced the olive yards, holding
one another’s hand, enjoying innocent converse in that
shady spot. The younger of the twain crooned a love
song with closed eyes.</p>

<p>All at once, as the black donkey came ambling by,
the pair sprang up suddenly, while the elder presented
a large and very curious pistol at the rider’s
head.</p>

<p>Upon that, seeing the miscreants were two, himself
but one, the servant turned and fled with the open
sunshade. A minute later, when the fat man lay on
the ground, puffing and cursing beneath the clever
hands of Nesìb, Hassan saw that servant afar off,
frantically endeavoring to climb a tree, while the
parasol, still open, adorned the ground close by, seeming
some strange white flower.</p>

<p>At that instant Nesìb swore roundly. The fat
man had bitten deep into the wrist of his despoiler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>“Pig of a citizen!” yelled the Thief. “I will
tear thy beard out. I will stab thy filthy eyes.”</p>

<p>He kicked his victim, and would have leapt
upon the hill of fatness had not Hassan Agha restrained
him.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, he shall be punished, and that at
once,” said the Circassian. “We asked but his
wealth; Allah witness, we bore no grudge to this man
more than to any other. But now, since he curses me
and has bitten my companion, the case is altered.”</p>

<p>So saying, he removed the saddlebags from the
donkey’s back, then, letting go the bridle, drove his
dagger into its flank. The black jackass screamed,
plunged, and careered away.</p>

<p>Nesìb, meanwhile, was employed in tearing the
raiment off the fallen fat one, now quite paralyzed
with rage. The despoiled gasped and gurgled convulsively.</p>

<p>“O Allah, help! Shall men rob and outrage the
Câdi of El Cûds, within call of the city, and live?
May Allah burn the abode of your wickedness. By
Allah, I shall be revenged. The day will come when
I shall send you forth to death. All robbers return
to me. I am the Câdi.”</p>

<p>“Câdi or pig, thou hadst no right to bite my
hand,” replied Nesìb severely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>Having stripped him to his silken shirt and his
voluminous drawers of white calico, Nesìb, for a further
insult, hoodwinked him with his own turban, and
bound together his wrists and ankles with strips cut
from the clothing taken from him. Then after Hassan
he climbed back over the wall.</p>

<p>From a discreet place they watched what should
befall. They saw the servant clamber down from out
his tree of refuge and, hesitating, with fearful glances,
approach his master. They saw him fumble with the
bonds. They heard the fat man’s scream of rage,
when at length he could rise; and observed him spit
upon that servant, striking his face repeatedly, so that
the coward fell on his knees and howled for mercy.
They waited to see no more, but, full of quiet mirth,
crept on their way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

</div>

<p>When Hassan Agha and the Thief reached the
abode of Zeyd’s wife’s relation, the sun had just sunk
beneath the western hill. The cooling waters of the
twilight overflowed the village and all the wady.
They found their comrades at the sheykh’s house instated
in the best room, the floor of which was laid
for a feast. The entire population crowded round the
open door, anxious to observe the manners of guests
so honorable.</p>

<p>“Allah witness, we will be no burden on you,”
said Hassan to their entertainer, after fervent greetings.
“We have money and, moreover, we shall
count it an honor to espouse your quarrels. Your
friends, our friends; your foes, our foes; your people
are from this hour the sworn brothers of my people.”</p>

<p>“May Allah reward your Excellencies! Behold,
we are dirt. The honor is too great!” The old
fellâh wagged his turbaned head most humbly.</p>

<p>“I with four of my comrades repair to the city
this night; but after a little while we shall return. In
the meanwhile, here is a trifle. Honor me by accepting.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
It is only right, since we are so great a
company.”</p>

<p>The sheykh of the village looked with awful reverence
upon a piece of shining gold. It seemed he
dared not take it. But when Hassan thrust it into his
palm, his fist clinched on it instantly. He faltered
praise to God, then wept a little.</p>

<p>About the third hour of night, Hassan set out once
more, taking with him Shibli and four of his own
men, the Thief among them. Once past the city gate,
it was his intention to send Shibli straight to the khan.
He had no wish to earn the rebuke of Shems-ud-dìn
by involving the youth in any serious mischief. But
as they rode along, Shibli pleaded so earnestly to be
allowed this opportunity of conquering his native cowardice,
that Hassan, foreseeing no danger, had not
the heart to deny him. After all, they were bound on
no adventure, but a simple business of fetching and
carrying, which could hurt no one.</p>

<p>In an olive grove at no great distance from the
walls, they dismounted and made fast the steeds, leaving
one of their number in charge of them. They had
not taken many steps from that place, the ground
being most uneven, when, with a yell, a man suddenly
disappeared below the surface of the earth. Eying
one another in terror, they missed the Thief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>A groan came from near at hand, ushering words
of anguish.</p>

<p>“Woe on me! Am I not most wretched? Do
not all things conspire against me? A black hog
wears my robe of honor; the lot falls on me to lose
my horse; a fat man bites my wrist in two; and now
the earth has opened his mouth and devoured me.
Allah, mercy! Woe! Woe on us!”</p>

<p>The Thief had stepped into a cistern long disused.
Leaning on their bellies round the brink, they managed
to grip hold of him, and at length, heaving together,
brought him up to the surface. He sank upon
the earth with a cry of pain. His legs were broken,
he asserted again and again. Useless for the expedition,
he was ordered to crawl back and keep watch
over the horses, while the man before charged with
that duty took on active service.</p>

<p>It was dark on all the face of the land. The city
wall was but a greater darkness as they followed it
on to the gate. Here they passed unchallenged. The
men in the guardhouse peeped out, laughing, and
wished them a happy night.</p>

<p>The bulk of the ancient fortress rose undefined
against the sky, which in that quarter showed no stars.
Clouds seemed to be rising, it might be for a thunderstorm,
the year’s last rain. On the narrow bridge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
which crossed the trench to the portal, Hassan
whispered:</p>

<p>“O Muhammed!”</p>

<p>“Ready, O my lord,” came the answer aloud.</p>

<p>“Is all well?”</p>

<p>“Be sure it is. No need to whisper. Only
friends hear us.”</p>

<p>“Then open and show us the place.”</p>

<p>“Gently, gently, O Excellency! I would first
hold thy gift in my hand, for an earnest of good faith.
Be not angry with Muhammed. Bethink thee, I
know thee but a little. And I have grave need of the
money. To thee it is nothing; to me much. Deign
to indulge thy servant, O my soul!”</p>

<p>“Good. Then I give thee the half. The other
half shall be thine when we come out with the things.”</p>

<p>“At thy pleasure, O lord of bounty!”</p>

<p>The gate was then opened, and Hassan made
his gift to the sentry. Muhammed peered at the
money and turned it over slowly, seeming dissatisfied.
Weighing it in his hand, he remonstrated:</p>

<p>“O my eyes, this is very little. For me alone, it
might suffice. But there are many besides me your
helpers in this business. Think not I could act as I
do, without the connivance of one or two of my
superiors. Then ... the guard at the gate....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“See here, take this and be content.” Hassan
doubled the sum given.</p>

<p>“It will serve, perhaps,” said Muhammed, with
a shrug. “Come, follow me.” But he continued to
grumble in an undertone.</p>

<p>Though the gate was left ostentatiously open
behind them, Shibli felt imprisoned. Too late,
he repented of his rashness in aspiring to vie
with brave men. As they followed the soldier
across the yard, he kept close to Hassan Agha for
protection.</p>

<p>Their guide unlocked a heavy door. He struck
a match and, shielding the flame with his hand,
showed them steps leading down to a vault.</p>

<p>“Deign to enter. Ennoble these Frankish
matches.”</p>

<p>“May thy house be destroyed! We need more
light than those provide,” objected Hassan testily.</p>

<p>“Cut thy life!” retorted Muhammed in anger.
“Didst think I would carry a lantern hither through
the common yard, to show any man our business who
may happen to be awake and looking out? By Allah,
you expect much, and give mighty little!”</p>

<p>“Aha, is it the smallness of the gift, my brother?
Thou shalt have more, much more, when we come
forth with the rifles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>Mollified by this assurance, Muhammed said
more civilly:</p>

<p>“On the right, a few paces from the foot of the
stair, you will find a lantern hanging by the wall. Be
careful to strike no match in the armory itself, for
there is much gunpowder.”</p>

<p>“Shibli, stay without and watch,” ordered
Hassan.</p>

<p>“No, no! Let me enter. For the love of Allah,
let me enter with you,” cried the youth, panic-stricken
at the prospect of being left alone.</p>

<p>“No, it were a sin for thee.”</p>

<p>“Enter none the less,” whispered Muhammed.
“It is a dungeon worth seeing. The walls, the roofs,
the pillars, are of the rarest workmanship. I will
keep watch instead of thee.”</p>

<p>Shibli required no urging to fulfill his one desire.
He slipped in after the Circassians, and the soldier, as
if for a precaution, closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>He felt his way down eight stone steps till he
found hard-trodden earth beneath his feet.</p>

<p>Presently, amid the darkness ahead of him, there
broke a storm of curses. A match was struck, forming
a cocoon of light in the distance. Hassan cried in
a terrible voice:</p>

<p>“Here is no lantern—no armory. And the door<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
is shut upon us. We are trapped, entombed. May
Allah slay me where I stand if I slay not ten men for
this trick upon us.”</p>

<p>Shibli crouched at the foot of the steps, annihilated,
a drumming in his ears. All at once the door
above opened, and shrouded figures entered from the
lesser darkness. It shut again ere Hassan and the rest
could come at it.</p>

<p>Shibli trembled as those forms brushed by him.
The smell of them was not the smell of men, but of
goats or camels, he knew not which. A guttural oath
from one of them and the words, “I touch a man,”
uttered in a tone of alarm, failed to humanize them.
But the stroke of a match and a gladsome shout from
Hassan—“The Bedû! Thanks to Allah!”—relieved
him of the shudder of the unknown, while multiplying
his fears a hundredfold. For that shout was
prelude to a frightful conflict of men fighting tooth
and nail in the dark, panting hard in the death
grapple, striking what they could not see.</p>

<p>Shibli heard groans, gasps, short screams of rage,
and the struggling fall of heavy bodies. His heart
beat in his brain. He shrank back up the steps to the
very door.</p>

<p>Just then the door opened, and, like a sword flash,
out leapt the maddened youth. He broke through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
two ranks of soldiers, oversetting some of them. He
was endued with the strength of ten men by the mortal
fright possessing him. Blinded by the shine of
many lanterns, he missed the gate at first and struck
the wall beside it. Rebounding and quickly collecting
himself, he dashed for the startled sentry, who, concluding
he had to deal with a supernatural agent,
wisely dodged the encounter.</p>

<p>“One has escaped, O my lord,” reported the
soldier Muhammed to his captain. “A youth, but a
youth of the devils. As well try to catch a bullet.”</p>

<p>“What matter!... Have you stopped the
fight in there? Drive them all forth.”</p>

<p>Hassan Agha and his three comrades, with all
who remained of their antagonists, emerged, torn and
bleeding, from the cellar. They blinked in the glare
of the lanterns. To their dazed apprehension it
seemed the whole city was arrayed against them. By
degrees their senses cleared somewhat. Having
dashed the blood from his eyes, Hassan descried Abd-ur-Rahman.</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah! Thou here, O child of my soul?
Is it a trick of thine? By my gun, thou hast fooled
us perfectly. It was a stratagem worthy of thy
father’s brother, worthy of Milhem Basha, the very
parent of guile.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>In the same playful tone Abd-ur-Rahman answered:</p>

<p>“It seemed desirable to read thee a little lesson, O
beloved. Thy endeavor has been to defame me; thou
madest light of my commands. To-night thou hast
thy wages.”</p>

<p>“But as for thee, I will pay thee soon or late, thou
lying dog.” Hassan turned fiercely upon the soldier
Muhammed.</p>

<p>That deceiver only laughed. “I scoff at thee, old
dotard. Thou art cross, it is natural. What is that
to me? I am once more Bimbashi, which is all I care
about. If thou didst think to outwit our young lord
here—thou with but two old eyes and the mind of a
bull—well, Allah bless thee, that is all.”</p>

<p>“What care I?” said Hassan, assuming a jaunty
air. “I have at least done something to pay off a
debt of long standing. We have slain a few of these
dwellers in the House of Hair, who slew my two sons.
To Allah praise therefore.”</p>

<p>“Now Allah witness. We knew thee not, nor
had ground of quarrel with thee,” cried a Bedawi,
who stood by, very sadly. “But now you have slain
my father and my brother, their blood cries for your
blood. It may prove a long story, but the end is
already written.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>A snarl of thunder in the distance gave a sinister
voice to the darkness which encompassed the lighted
crowd. Hassan Agha turned again to Abd-ur-Rahman.</p>

<p>“What would a certain old man think of this
treatment of one who loved thee?” he asked with
deep meaning, almost with authority. “What would
the saintly——”</p>

<p>“Enough said!” cried Abd-ur-Rahman; and by
the haste of his ejaculation Hassan knew himself
secure from public dishonor. “I intend not to disgrace
so old a friend. Pay ten pounds Turk for distribution
among the soldiers under my command, or
in default of that sum—which I think you could
hardly make up among you—give me a mare from
your cavalry, and it is finished between us.”</p>

<p>“The money is with me,” said Hassan, with a
chastened gleam of satisfaction; for he knew that
Abd-ur-Rahman desired the mare. A gleeful murmur
spread among the soldiery.</p>

<p>“With these sons of wandering I will be lenient
in like manner. Ten pounds Turk, or one of their
thoroughbred mares; that is the price of escape. But
first, in their case, it is necessary that I see some
certificate of their discharge from the military
service.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>“A’al! He is wise. May Allah preserve Abd-ur-Rahman,
coming glory of the realm.”</p>

<p>Hassan stayed to hear no more. He paid his fine
with the money taken from the Câdi, and slunk away
out of the sphere of the lantern light. Hearing laughter,
he ground his teeth and vowed vengeance senselessly.
The watch at the gate of the city turned out
to mock him and his companions, inquiring whence
those blood stains, where the rifles, and so forth.</p>

<p>Flashes of lightning illumined the country fitfully.
The stars were covered. Thunder rolled, now near,
now distant. In the olive grove where they had left
their steeds, it began to rain, big drops, which shook
the leaves. The whinny and stamp of the horses
guiding them, they found the place.</p>

<p>The Thief lay on his back, groaning, just as they
had left him. His legs were broken, he moaned. He
told how, as he lay looking up at the sky, he had seen
a sword flash forth from heaven over the Holy City,
and heard a great voice cry:</p>

<p>“Die, all of you!”</p>

<p>He supposed that Allah would destroy those
wicked townsfolk, and Hassan thought it very likely.</p>

<p>“Great has been my sin. I will hide none of it
from thee. The face of the girl struck terror in me
when I beheld it that time beneath the magic tree.
My soul abhorred her. I prayed—O my more than
father, curse me not! I prayed that thy child might
die. And when thy worthier prayers prevailed, when
she came safe to the Frank physician, I cared not
what thing I became. I gave up my soul to wickedness;
I exchanged thy wise company for that of the
noisy ones; I entered into every device of Hassan
Agha and his companions; I surpassed them all in violence;
I robbed, I fought, I slew. Last night I slew
Allah knows how many men. I alone was granted
strength to escape that I might ask thy forgiveness.
All the rest, the fierce, the mighty ones, are
dead.”</p>

<p>Shibli, who had stood beating his breast before
Shems-ud-dìn, here fell down upon the ground and
wept convulsively.</p>

<p>With the sun he had come to the Haràm, to the
cell where, from distress of mind, the sheykh had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
chosen to pass that night of storm. Shems-ud-dìn
knew not what to make of his mad appearance and
wild words. The bondman of far other griefs, he
looked at Zeyd, then at surrounding objects—the fair
Dome set as a rock in mid-stream of the sunrise, some
dark forms crowned with white turbans stalking
gravely in its shadow—but could only shake his head
and smile wearily. He saw no sense anywhere. The
soft, husky coo of pigeons, the golden calm, discredited
that tale of sin and horror.</p>

<p>“May Allah take my life also,” moaned Shibli,
prostrate on the time-worn pavement. “I am unworthy
to live longer in thy sight. As I lay all night
in the door of the khan, supposing thee to be within,
the wrath of Allah thundered against me. I cannot
survive this hour.”</p>

<p>The sheykh glanced at Zeyd with raised eyebrows,
as who should say, What make you of this riddle?
The fellâh replied:</p>

<p>“He is distraught. Be sure it is some bad joke
of the sons of Eblìs. By some contrivance they have
driven him mad with fear. May Allah affright the
whole race of them, and that suddenly.”</p>

<p>“Alas, wish no evil upon them, for they are dead.
All of them slain in the darkness under ground. I
alone broke away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn gazed with compassion upon the
sobbing liar. His mind, purged by grief, saw round
the story and accurately appraised it.</p>

<p>“Do a kindness, O Zeyd,” he said at length.
“Go to the Chief of the Learned. At this hour thou
wilt find him in the mosque El Aksa. Repeat to him
the tale, and beseech him to ascertain the truth for us.
He has influence with the rulers of the city, and can
come at the rights of it.”</p>

<p>Zeyd sped on the errand. Shibli lay crushed
before the sheykh, groaning and weeping, praying for
death and forgiveness.</p>

<p>“What can I do to atone? O lord, I will marry
thy daughter when the Frank has healed her. See,
my soul is between thy two feet.”</p>

<p>In accents of mild wonder the sheykh replied:</p>

<p>“What is this thou sayest of my daughter?
Allah forbid that I should victimize thee. Never,
unless by the especial grace of Allah, will she live
to be given in marriage. Why hast thou hid thy
thought from me? I had not blamed nor in any wise
constrained thee. The affections of a young man are
winds blowing hot or cold on him; he discerns neither
their goal nor their origin; nor can in aught control
them. He can but entreat Allah to order them for
his soul’s weal. Is it for this thou hast shunned me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
these many days? Be comforted. I forgive thee, O
my son.”</p>

<p>The convulsion of Shibli’s frame abated gradually
till he lay in peace, broken only at lengthening intervals
by a kind of catch in the breath, like a hiccough.
The coo of the mosque pigeons again predominated.</p>

<p>Zeyd soon returned, accompanied by a tall black-bearded
man of somber habit, with eyes of coal set
deep in a sallow visage.</p>

<p>“The revered Mahmûd in this hour vouchsafes
instruction to his disciples. He cannot himself come
to thee. But with his peace, and in hope of thy forgiveness,
he sends an excellent sheykh who can certify
thee concerning the whole matter, being already apprised
of it from the mouth of his brother, a high
officer of the garrison.”</p>

<p>Zeyd delivered the message with unction. The
words of the Chief of the Learned were as sweetmeats
in his mouth.</p>

<p>With a formal salutation the reverend sheykh,
thus presented, sat down crosslegged before the cell,
and spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“Know, O my uncle, that there exists among the
garrison of this city a youth of good lineage and high
influence, his name Abd-ur-Rahman Bey. The same,
coming lately in charge of the armory, forbade those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
thefts of rifles and ammunition, by connivance of the
soldiery, which are common in provincial garrisons.
But his subordinates, accustomed to view official prohibitions
but as pretty cloaks, proceeded, at the time
of the great feast of the Nazarenes, when all kinds of
people flock to our city, to negotiate as usual for the
sale of rifles. Abd-ur-Rahman has an eagle’s eyesight.
He discovered their disobedience, and punished
it severely, degrading some of the culprits, imprisoning
others. Then, hearing how those who had
hoped to obtain arms, proclaimed in the taverns their
intention still to get them in his despite, he set a trap
for the boasters. He sent out those soldiers whom he
had before punished, to entice them to the Tower,
securing fidelity in his agents by the promise of his
favor should they succeed.</p>

<p>“Allah prospered his strategy. Last night a
great number of Circassians and a whole tribe of the
Bedû were trapped by him in a dungeon beneath the
Tower; where, in the dark, the two nations fell to
fighting to such purpose that, when the door was
opened, only four of either faction were left alive.”
(“The praise to Allah,” interjected Shibli. “All
four of them lived to emerge.”) “Then Abd-ur-Rahman,
seeing they had punished one another,
grew lenient. He laid a fine upon each party. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
Circassians paid the fine and went free. The Bedû,
lacking money, offered instead a fine mare of the
best blood of the desert. But Abd-ur-Rahman,
having chanced to find out that none of them had
served his time in the army, holds them prisoners, and
has taken all their horses. That is the whole story,
O my uncle.”</p>

<p>“How plain I see thee, O my brother Milhem,”
murmured Shems-ud-dìn, with a deep sigh. “O
Allah, behold the wickedness done in this city which
Thou hast hallowed.”</p>

<p>“Ah, there I hold with thee, O my uncle,” said
the black-bearded sheykh heartily. “She is indeed the
mistress of perversity, this city, whose soil is holy.
The like has been observed of El Khalìl and other
sanctuaries, and especially of Mekka itself. The
wicked throng the markets of the good. It is lucky
that we of the congregation can still exert some sway
over the agents of government, or El Cûds would be
polluted and defiled by those who, if their faith were
earnest, should esteem her most highly—that is, by
the Nazarenes. Not once or twice have we opposed
the establishment of a place of ribaldry by certain
Franks, who still importune the authorities. And we
allow no harlot within our gates. The Council of
Notables sides with us, fortunately, or the town would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
soon be as foul with naked sin as are the cities of the
Franks. The government would soon succumb to the
temptation of their bribes....”</p>

<p>The young sheykh, whose eyes had kindled as he
embarked upon a favorite topic, here brought his remarks
to an abrupt conclusion. Only Shems-ud-dìn
made even a pretense of listening, and in his face was
every mark of abstraction. Zeyd and Shibli, on their
heels, were talking apart in whispers. Rising, the instructor
bowed so low before Shems-ud-dìn that the
whole circle of his white turban was seen for a moment,
a ring round a scarlet disk, then, with the
words, “In thy grace,” he stalked off umbrageously
toward a group of cypress trees, where others of his
kind were sitting in the shade.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn at length observed that the sun was
high. Waking out of dreams, he brushed his hand
across his eyes.</p>

<p>“The house of the Frank should be astir by this
time,” he said. “Wilt thou, O my son, come with
me thither?”</p>

<p>“Upon my head.... Nevertheless, since it is
now known that Hassan is not slain, I would fain seek
him out, and hear his tale, which must be a strange
one.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn gazed on Shibli’s brightened countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
and his eyes were earnest though he seemed
to smile. Distressed by that searching look, the youth
hung his head and faltered:</p>

<p>“Allah witness, I go with thee gladly—very
gladly. It was for afterwards——”</p>

<p>“I did but tempt thee, O my son. I require thee
not. But how long wilt thou strive to deceive me?”</p>

<p>He touched Shibli’s hand affectionately and would
have left him; but the youth ran after, imploring forgiveness.
Gently he shook him off, saying:</p>

<p>“Go in peace, my soul. Allah forbid that I
should load thee with a grief not thine. Think not I
blame thee. Go and hear the story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

</div>

<p>When Shems-ud-dìn knocked that morning at the
door of the Frank’s house, it was opened to him immediately.
Zeyd had not time to exchange the usual
compliments with a sherbet seller, who had his stall
higher up the alley, in the shade of a little entry which
alone broke the monotony of its high blind walls.
Ismaìl, the black doorkeeper, had been on the watch
for their coming.</p>

<p>“Is it thou, O my lord?” he exclaimed, grinning
welcome. “The hakìm would speak with thy Grace.
He is now at meat, but will soon have done. Deign
to enter here.”</p>

<p>Instead of conducting Shems-ud-dìn as usual
through the cool scoured passage out into the court
and so up to the sick room, the black opened the
door of a chamber adjoining the entrance—a closet
sparsely furnished in the Frankish manner, where the
unbeliever used to receive those who came to make
trial of his skill in medicine. Zeyd thought to pass in
with his master, but Ismaìl restrained him by a strong
friendly clasp of his shoulder. The door was closed,
and Shems-ud-dìn left alone to his meditations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>Set uneasily upon a chair, his feet tucked under
him as far as the awkwardness of the contrivance
would allow, he took stock of the little room, its cleanness,
the tall, spindle-shanked furniture, the mats of
some vegetable fiber, and the buzz of flies beneath its
vaulted ceiling. Upon a table in one corner stood two
wooden boxes linked together by a slack cord. Those
boxes gave a focus to his contemplation. In the inner
chamber of so great a scientist, he supposed them to
possess some occult virtue. Yet, all the while he sat
gazing on them and on the room in general, he cared
not a jot for anything there, but prayed only for the
hakìm to come quickly and make known his latest
judgment upon Alia.</p>

<p>At last the Frank looked in, coming straight from
meat, as a reminiscent munching testified.</p>

<p>“O sheykh!” he poured forth in that rapid,
garbled speech of his, which galloped as if to escape
from its own inaccuracy. “May thy day be happy
and blessed. For thy daughter, alas! the end is very
near. Stay with her to-day, I beg of thee. My house
is thy house. I go now about my business. In thy
grace!”</p>

<p>So saying, and before Shems-ud-dìn could touch
his hand or frame an answer, he was gone again. In
his place came Mâs, who ushered his master out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
through the sunny court and up the stairs to the door
of the sick room. The fragrance of that room, its
cool, sweet air, refreshed Shems-ud-dìn.</p>

<p>“Praise be to Allah!” cried Fatmeh, in response
to his formal query. In a posture of triumph, she
waved him on toward the bed. “See her smile to
welcome her dear father. Is she not almost recovered?
Never again did I think to behold her so well,
so happy! O light of my eyes! O my pretty one!
O life! O happy day!”</p>

<p>As he sat upon a pile of cushions arranged for
him by Fatmeh beside the bed, the reasonable speech
and ready smile of the beloved came near to persuade
Shems-ud-dìn that the physician had lied to him. All
day long he sat there, happier than ever since his coming
to El Cûds; and that unowned hope which keeps
the door of enjoyment locked out fears. Once he
even echoed Fatmeh when she praised Allah for the
girl’s perfect recovery. His intelligence was relaxed,
off guard, a plaything for mocking devils, it seemed
to him afterwards.</p>

<p>At length, when it wore toward evening, Fatmeh
went out for a while, leaving Shems-ud-dìn alone at
the bedside. He held the hand of his daughter, a
bird’s claw for thinness. No word passed till Alia
said earnestly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“O my father!”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn quickened instantly out of his half-abstraction.
His brain throbbing with intensity of
interest, he answered:</p>

<p>“What is there, O my daughter?”</p>

<p>“There is this, my father: I fear much to die. I
fear the great darkness and the loneliness. Thou
knowest how I always have feared to be alone in darkness,
how I feel a jinni clutch me, and I scream. O
my dearest, O Allah, what shall I do in a darkness
which has no boundary, in a silence whence no scream
is ever heard?”</p>

<p>She clasped her father’s arm and clung to it, trembling.
Shems-ud-dìn, leaning over her, heartrent by
the horror in her dilated eyes, ransacked his brain for
words to calm her.</p>

<p>“Take comfort, O beloved!” he whispered.
“Doubtless there is a place for thee in the garden
of Allah.”</p>

<p>“Yes, O my father. Think not I forget all instruction.
But that paradise is a shadowy place. It
seems to me, as I lie here and think, that a doubt encircles
it. It is but a shadow of that sure and glorious
one reserved for men. Hear now my prayer, O my
father; it is for that I called to thee. When thou,
judged righteous, art with the blessed, deign to remember<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
me, thy daughter, and ask of Allah the favor
of my presence with thee. The dark-eyed maids will
not hate me, for I am thy daughter; and it is allowed
thee to ask for a woman dear to thee on the earth.”</p>

<p>“Thou art no woman of mine, in that sense——”</p>

<p>“Hush, O my father! Ask only. Make petition.
Is not His mercy boundless? Oh, how I have longed
to know that place, the talking fruit, the tree, the
wondrous birds, and the voice melodious, and the joy
in God’s presence. Promise to ask for me, and my
fear will be much less.”</p>

<p>“If Allah will, if at the last day I be judged fit
for salvation, then be sure I will fulfill thy petition, O
light of my eyes!”</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief, she loosed hold of him and
sank back upon the pillows, closing her eyes. It was
some time ere she again opened them. Then, meeting
her father’s troubled gaze, she smiled languidly,
almost voluptuously.</p>

<p>“Be not too sorrowful, O my dear! May Allah
reward that kind thought of thine which brought me
hither. Here is like paradise. It is part of my fear
to die that I must leave this pleasant room—of a light
subdued, yet how cheerful!—and the pure sweet
odors, and the loving tendance. But what matter!
All is allotted.” She paused before adding in a more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
detached strain, as though trying to view herself
through strange eyes: “Knowest thou, O my father,
that, did it please Allah to preserve me in life, I think
I should pray thee to give me to this good hakìm and
not to Shibli. When I suffer pain, the hakìm needs
but to look on me and it is gone. His touch is gentle,
and his eyes are not as the eyes of Shibli, but rather
resemble thine, O my father——”</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly, for just then the door of
the room opened and the hakìm himself entered, followed
by Fatmeh and an unveiled woman who also
waited upon Alia.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn withdrew. He knew now that the
hakìm had told truth when he said that the end was
very near. He saw his late torpor of enjoyment, and
the still evident delight of Fatmeh, in their true colors,
the colors of the sunset hour, the fairest of the
day, the gate of night. The sun of a blinding love
drew near his setting.</p>

<p>Going down into the court, he spoke with Zeyd
and the two old negroes till the hakìm came forth
from Alia, when he ran and clutched his raiment.</p>

<p>“Let me talk with thee, O lord of bounty!”</p>

<p>“Willingly. We will go to the housetop; it is
pleasant at this hour.”</p>

<p>On the housetop, moving in the blaze of the sinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
sun, the Frank explained to Shems-ud-dìn, as well
as his knowledge of the Arabic would permit, the
nature and peculiar symptoms of Alia’s malady. It
was incurable, he had said so from the first. He had
done what man could to relieve the pain of it, and increase
by a little the number of her days. There was
nothing more on earth that he could do. Even supposing
she might live, which was impossible, the mere
life deprived of certain organs would be ghastly torture,
no blessing, but a very curse.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn, hearing him theorize thus, and mistaking
the tenor of his jumbled words, on a sudden
wave of longing forgot even Allah Most High.
From his sinful heart he cried:</p>

<p>“Save but the life of her, the life alone! She
dead, what have I left on earth to care for?”</p>

<p>Almost fiercely, he gripped the wrist of the Frank,
repeating:</p>

<p>“Save but the life, O best of physicians, and may
Allah bless thee ever!”</p>

<p>But the name of Allah, glaring in that connection,
showed him in a flash the vanity, the gross impiety, of
his behavior. Heart-humbled, he let go the arm of
the Frank. His head drooped, tears filled his eyes.</p>

<p>The Frank beheld his frenzy and the consequent
collapse with more of pity than surprise. He said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>“Thou understandest not. I can do nothing
more than is done already. Stay here awhile. Let
the air refresh thee. I descend once more into the
house.”</p>

<p>He then embarked upon some statement beyond
his command of language to express. Shems-ud-dìn
gathered from a word caught here and there that this
Frank was censured of other Nazarenes for receiving
the girl in his house, even as he himself had earned
the reproach of other Muslims by allowing her to lie
there. The sheykh could only thank him with tears
in his eyes.</p>

<p>The sun’s chin touched the outer roofs to westward.
On that side, the city seemed of hewn shadow
up against a fire; on the other, ruddy light held all the
terraces, with shadow only in their crannies which
were streets. Shems-ud-dìn, seated on a high roof,
was aware vaguely of a conflagration of all heaven.
He thought on the last day, when the sun shall drop
so near that the brains of the wicked shall boil like
water. He remained unconscious of the attendance
of Zeyd, the son of Abbâs, who, seeing the Frank descend,
had crept up stealthily, not to be defrauded of
a moment of that blest companionship which fed his
soul.</p>

<p>Not until the sun had long set, and Shems-ud-dìn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
had said his prayers, did Zeyd venture to assert his
presence by a sigh and a rustling movement.</p>

<p>“Is it thou, O father of kindness?” asked the
sheykh dreamily.</p>

<p>And Zeyd, proud to answer to so sweet a name,
said:</p>

<p>“It is none other, O my master.”</p>

<p>“Do a kindness, O my friend. Go down, I pray
thee, and inquire in the house if my daughter wakes
and would see me.”</p>

<p>“On my head,” answered Zeyd, at once rising.
It seemed but a second to Shems-ud-dìn ere the same
voice said, “Thy daughter sleeps. The Frank has
given her a soothing potion.”</p>

<p>“Blest are thy tidings. Then I wait here till Mâs
shall call me.”</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

</div>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn fell back on reverie. Above the
black gauze veil of earth, the stars beat slumberously.
Across the terraced roofs came the voice of one singing,
with the twang of a lute. The song was all of
love. Now it rose to a frenzied howl, now sank to a
passionate moan. From time to time, among the hidden
ways beneath, a strife of dogs broke out, raged
noisily for a space, and then subsided.</p>

<p>A great weariness beset the sheykh—the accumulated
claims of all the nights and days when he had
shunned repose. Though he wrestled with it, aware
that now, more than ever, there was call to watch,
little by little that lassitude overpowered him. He
beheld the star-flecked sky for a while fitfully, as if a
curtain flapped between it and his eyes. Then he saw
no more of sky, or stars, or darkness veiling the face
of earth.</p>

<p>He dreamed.</p>

<p>He sat again in his shop in the small bazaar, with
hands outspread over the brazier. He heard the
chime of camel bells. Some one spoke behind him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
when, turning, he beheld an afrìt of baleful aspect,
having eyes of flame. And what that devil bade him
do, that perforce he did, though well knowing that it
was against his own soul.</p>

<p>At blush of day he set out from his small white
city of the tawny hills, and the people thronged about
him, called him holy, cried to him for a blessing.
And he blessed them—he, the slave of evil. The
welkin rang with laughter of foul fiends.</p>

<p>He stood beneath the dying tree, denouncing
Fatmeh as in righteous anger. And as the woman
writhed in anguish at his feet, a voice came from
within the litter, “Is the woman’s sin above thine?
Hast not thou recourse to another than Allah, a creature
no more potent than this tree?”</p>

<p>He fell down and strove to pray. But his prayer
went crooked, turned away from God. That jinni
was at his ear, distracting him.</p>

<p>So he arose and went his way through the tainted
air. Friends turned to foes. Old friends grinned
aside, mocking him.</p>

<p>Then came one who mistook him for a saint—a
poor man, good and faithful. He longed to undeceive
him, but could not, the devil preventing.</p>

<p>He stood in the smiling court of the Frank’s
house. He knelt; he prostrated himself; he offered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
gifts; he prayed to that unbeliever in place of Allah;
wide awake to the sin he thus committed, yet constrained
thereto by the evil thing possessing him.</p>

<p>“Save but the life! but the life alone!” he cried;
and the infidel, though something loath, consented.</p>

<p>Abd-ur-Rahman, Shibli, Hassan—all old friends
forsook him. Only that simple one, who believed in
him, still clung to him with reverence. The aged
Chief of the Learned, all wise men, remonstrated with
him. He saw their mouths open and shut, he felt
their disapproval; but his mind made nothing of what
they said.</p>

<p>“Save but the life!” he cried in their defiance.</p>

<p>He sat in a chamber of the Frank’s house and
waited, his soul racked with suspense. The chair on
which he sat proved an instrument of torture, crushing
both his feet.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a man moved in the room with him,
supporting something with both hands.</p>

<p>“The life is saved, O sheykh, the life only. See
it here before thee.”</p>

<p>The speaker turned, revealing the earth-hued
face, the eyes of flame, of that same jinni who had
beguiled him at the first. His laugh had the rattle
of dry bones as he repeated: “Behold what it is, the
life only!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>Then he looked and saw two wooden boxes united
by a thin cord, which writhed and twisted between
them like a living worm. The tops of the boxes also
seemed alive, for they rose and fell regularly like the
breast of a sleeper. He stared terror-stricken, fixed
to that accursed chair. He saw his poor disciple approach
the life and lift both hands in admiration of
the rare contrivance. He realized the stupendous
mockery of the hope, inspired by devils, which had
led him on through sin after sin—for this.</p>

<p>Then, as he glowered upon that fruit of evil, the
pulse of the barren life grew faint and fainter, the
cord more languid in its twistings. In dread lest
even that should escape him, by a mighty effort he
wrenched himself free of the chair. Men seized him,
wrestled with him, but he broke away, crying:</p>

<p>“O Allah, mercy! It is the life.”</p>

<p>There came a shock, a flood of darkness. The
stars shone above him, among them the waning moon,
late risen, like a flower’s curled petal. Some one bent
over him, grasping his shoulder. A woman’s wail
came from below, in the house.</p>

<p>“Allah witness, Zeyd and I have striven hard to
wake thee, O my master. It is now too late. Thou
hearest that voice of woe, the voice of Fatmeh. Peace
to the beloved. She is but now dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>“Praise be to Allah! What is the hour?”</p>

<p>“It nears the dawn, O my master.”</p>

<p>“It is seemly that we make arrangements for her
burial this day. Allah forbid that I should trespass
any longer upon the kindness of this stranger. I will
make him a suitable present, and then, having buried
the body of my soul, we will return to our own place.”</p>

<p>“Spare thyself all concern,” said Mâs gently.
“Ismaìl, the doorkeeper, is more skilled than we are
in the ways of this city. And he values thee above all
living men. He will bargain for a plot of ground,
and smooth the way of thy grief before thee.”</p>

<p>“May Allah give peace to him and to thee!
Nevertheless, I shall go with him to direct his judgment.”</p>

<p>In all the words of Shems-ud-dìn there was now
a note of decision, almost cheerful, much at variance
with his recent listless sorrow. Mâs and Zeyd ebn
Abbâs marveled at his might of resignation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2>

</div>

<p>Impelled more by shame than prudence, Hassan
Agha lay perdue with his men two days and nights
after his outwitting by the garrison of El Cûds. The
hours of sunlight were spent in lounging about the
village of Zeyd’s wife’s relation, sitting smoking in
the shade of the olive yards, or under screen of a rock
in the wady; glozing over their defeat until, to the
mind’s eye, it wore the hue of misfortune, and they
were no more shamed.</p>

<p>At break of the third day, when Hassan awoke
and stretched himself, his host, already afoot, announced
his mind to go presently to the city and visit
Zeyd, the son of Abbâs. His desire was not, he confessed,
so much to see Zeyd himself, who was a poor
man like another, as to greet once more that holy one
by whom his house was honored, to inquire of his
health and obtain his blessing.</p>

<p>“Thy desire is my own,” said Hassan, yawning
audibly. “Wait a little and we will go together, thou
and I and all my people.”</p>

<p>A little later, the peasant having mounted a light-colored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
ass, they rode over the hill, a goodly company.
Every one of Hassan’s band was there, not excepting
the Thief, who instead of boots wore bandages, tied
for him by Ali, who boasted some skill in surgery.</p>

<p>“What? You return to school, all of you?”
cried a soldier in the city gate. “Is it possible that
you need a second lesson?”</p>

<p>Masking discomfort beneath a genial smile, Hassan
cried peace on the merry rogue.</p>

<p>The street within was crowded, obliging them to
ride slowly in single file. The sun, risen clear of the
roofs, was hot overhead; and the honeycomb of whitish
stone seemed an oven constructed on purpose to
retain and diffuse the heat. It was hotter than high
noon, for noon is ever tempered by some breeze.</p>

<p>They rode to the khan and there dismounted,
stabling their horses with the aid and blessing of a
ragged hostler. The host came forth likewise and
blessed them. By Allah, it enlivened all things to behold
them once again. What had become of the excellent
sheykh, their friend? His horse, his two
mules, and the donkey of his companion were yet,
they might see, in the stable. But for three whole
days, to-day the fourth, he had not been vouchsafed
a glimpse of the sheykh himself. True, an old negro
whom he knew not—a taciturn black dog—had come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
yesterday and brought him money on the sheykh’s
behalf. But he was not one to think only of gain.
By Allah, no! He liked to see his patrons each day,
to exchange greetings with them, and assure himself
they were happy.</p>

<p>“Doubtless we shall find him by the sanctuary,”
suggested Shibli, in an undertone; whereupon, taking
leave of the host, they trooped toward the Sacred
Close. In their midst, Zeyd’s wife’s relation carried
a jar of dried fruits and a bag of olives for an offering
to the saint’s glory.</p>

<p>Outside the circuit hallowed from of yore, near
the foot of a flight of steps, sat a very aged man in
converse with another not so old. The pair sat crosslegged
against the wall of a fair white shrine whose
shadow covered them. Hard by, a withered tree
veined the ground with deep, blue shade.</p>

<p>“It is the Chief of the Learned!” exclaimed
Shibli, with bated breath. Running forward, he did
obeisance to the elder of the two seated. The younger
rose in acknowledgment of the civility.</p>

<p>“Who is there, O my brother?” quavered the
sage, whose eyes were dim. “Who is he that hails
me thus by name? My ears detect the footsteps of
a crowd. Doubtless they are pilgrims to the sanctuary—none
like it under heaven, save only the House<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
of God which is in Mekka. The mercy of Allah
upon you, O true believers! Forgive me though I
remain seated. I am old and somewhat feeble, O
my children.”</p>

<p>But when Shibli humbly submitted that they were
not come now as pilgrims, but simply in quest of the
Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn, that old man put off the divine,
exclaiming with interest:</p>

<p>“You seek that good man, that marvel of instruction?
You are his companions of the road? Then
are you entitled to a second welcome from me. You
ask, where is he now? Ah, of that I cannot certify
you. Within this hour he left me—he and the poor
man who cleaves to him, and a white-beard Ethiopian,
his servant—saying he would go and visit his daughter’s
grave.”</p>

<p>“Is the girl then dead and buried?” the Circassians
murmured of consternation.</p>

<p>“Have you not heard? Like many of our human
ills, it is in truth a blessing. For had Allah granted
life to that girl, our friend had deemed her rescued by
the Frank, and so been confirmed in an error of which
I strove oft to disabuse him, namely: that it can be
lawful to frequent an obstinate unbeliever and to put
faith in him—aye, even a faith beyond that in one’s
own kindred, making him the keeper of a young girl<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
that was a virgin, ascribing to him that power of
life and death which is the prerogative of God
alone. Have we not cause to rejoice that so great
and insidious an error is rooted out ere it could
corrupt the heart of a man the best that draws
breath?</p>

<p>“I praise Allah hourly for His compassion in
enforcing the argument which I, His humble bondman,
could not persuade our excellent sheykh so much
as to hear with tolerance. His mind is changed,
thanks to Allah! He now owns his sin. In return,
I invited him to lead the morning prayer....
Praise to Allah!... But what is here? What
wouldst thou?”</p>

<p>Zeyd’s wife’s relation, hearing such heavenly
words, and weary of forever carrying a pot of dried
fruits and a bag of olives, had laid those gifts at the
sage’s feet, himself with them in prayer for their
acceptance.</p>

<p>“What is this? Thou bringest gifts—thou
whose speech is of the poorest! The poor inherit the
privileges of the rich, who nowadays have forsworn
liberality. From the hand of Allah thou shalt get
reward. Hereafter thou shalt taste the fruits of
paradise, basking in shade, and to the strains of an
exquisite music.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>“O Glory! O Holiness! I am thy debtor till
the Last Day!” cried the fellâh, at so rich a promise.
Snuffling, with streaming eyes, he went after the Circassians.</p>

<p>Once more they plunged into the city’s stifled
ways.</p>

<p>“This is like hunting a partridge among the hills.
‘Here he was a minute since’; and now, behold! he
has flitted across the wady. For him but a spread of
the wings, for me an hour’s rough walking!” muttered
Hassan, wiping his brow. For a pace he strode
in silence, frowning moodily. All at once he cried out:
“Is that an English physician? I think not, by Allah!
The English physician swears by his word, but this
dog is a cunning liar. In like manner, seeming most
upright, making grave promises, did their knowing
ones deliver up our land to the Muscovite. May
Allah destroy that nation and blot out the remembrance
of it from on earth! Behold us perfectly befooled!
May Allah burn that infidel! He received
the girl into his house, he made a covenant with us
to heal her. He took our gifts, and much money from
the Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn. And now he has killed the
girl. Doubtless he had deflowered her secretly, and
so dared not leave her in life.”</p>

<p>From further exposition he was diverted by a cry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
most bitter, the cry of one struck down by a treacherous
blow.</p>

<p>“Woe, woe on me!... The pride of my house—that
ancient garment! It is made nothing; it is
despised, defiled! It is passed from one dog to
another!... O dishonor!... O Lord, let me
slay that infidel! O Allah, destroy his house with
fire this minute!... Him and the black hog, I will
kill them both. Have they not earned death?...
Ah, woe! woe!”</p>

<p>Nesìb the Thief had broken away from the cherishing
arm of Ali, his sworn brother, and now stood
unsteadily, with hands upraised to a strip of sky,
shrieking curses and blubbering by turns. His face
was convulsed with anguish. Ali hovered near with
soothing words, ready to catch the rocking cripple
should he fall.</p>

<p>“Right is with the Thief,” cried Hassan loudly.
“It is one thing to be fooled by Abd-ur-Rahman—a
child of our house; but by an unbeliever,
with whom we dealt too honorably, that is quite
another. For the name of the Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn,
for our own good name, it behooves us to
take vengeance. Y’Allah! To his house, O my
children.”</p>

<p>Already upon the shouting, strange forms had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
come about them, strange voices asked of the matter.
When, at Hassan’s exhortation, they surged onward,
a crowd, three parts Christian, of facile sympathizers
went with them. The Thief, still weeping passionately,
submitted once more to the tender solicitude of
his sworn brother. The aged relative of Zeyd ebn
Abbâs had disappeared.</p>

<p>They had not far to go. One quiet alley and a
short tunnel brought them into the way which led
past the door of the Frank. In the manner of a stone
rolled downward, they gained momentum from the
fact of moving. The murmur of their indignation
swelled to a roar.</p>

<p>Between the high, blank walls, one light, one
shadowed, a solitary man was seen running for dear
life. It was the sherbet seller who, finding his quiet
lane the highway of a yelling rout, had forgotten his
stall of cooling drinks.</p>

<p>The mob swayed and eddied for a moment
ere it broke upon the door of the Frank physician.
All who could come at it beat upon that door;
many more, out of sympathy, beat the surrounding
wall.</p>

<p>“Open, open, O cursed heathen! Down with the
door! The door yields not. Bring fire. Who
has fire?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>A woman’s voice squealed within. The assailants
paused to hear what was said.</p>

<p>“What is this, forsooth? Merciful Allah, are
these manners? ‘A thousand knock-knock-knocks
and no salâm aleykûm.’ Ismaìl is out. I will not
open. I shall tell of you to the hakìm.”</p>

<p>At that the hammering, the shouts, and the yells
redoubled, till of a sudden some one cried, “Look
up!” and all eyes sought the roof line. There, leaning
on the parapet, was the hakìm himself. He held
a gun, not pointed menacingly, but simply, as it
seemed, for their inspection.</p>

<p>“Go, or I shoot!” he cried.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, a knife whizzed so near as to
graze his cheek. The muzzles of a dozen guns commanded
him. Then some stones flew up; but by that
time he was no more seen.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! He is an old woman, this great
hakìm!” shouted Hassan. “Another kind of English
led the fight at Kars. This is no better than
some skulking townsman. O shame, to bear the
insult of such an one.”</p>

<p>Derisive laughter mingled with the howl of execration.
But, realizing that the business was like to
go beyond a frolic, many Christians and other chance
allies began to edge away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“Bring fire! Burn the door! Make fire the baw-wâb!”
cried one of the Circassians.</p>

<p>At once the more zealous of his comrades tried
to coax a flame by means of foreign matches and rags
torn from their own clothing. But already the more
lukewarm were dropping off. The sight of some running
made others run. The panic became general.
Hassan did not hinder the flight. He considered
enough had been done for the present to scare the
Frank.</p>

<p>“Stop running. Scatter! scatter!” he shouted
for their instruction.</p>

<p>In a moment, had the watch appeared, they would
have found no mob, but divers groups of men walking
inoffensively—nay, timidly—in divers directions.
Like a sand storm in the desert of the south, the riot
had arisen, raged, and was clean gone, all in a short
quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>“Where is our good fellâh? Where Ali?
Where Nesìb?” said Hassan to Shibli, who had clung
to him throughout the tumult. “Small wonder if
some were swept astray by that sudden blast. Allah
pardon! Saw man ever the like of it?”</p>

<p>He proceeded to make inquiry of those he saw
stationary in the markets, if anyone had seen a tall
old man of a noble countenance, attended by one who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
seemed a beggar, in all respects, saving only that he
did not beg. At last one answered:</p>

<p>“I have seen the very man; and with them a lean
old negro who kept grinning without mirth,” and
pointed out which road the three had taken.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

</div>

<p>Nesìb the Thief was left before the house of the
physician. Unable to run or help himself because of
his injured legs, he must have been knocked down
and trampled in that panic rush, but for the tender
care of Ali, who fought manfully to protect him.
But the Thief himself was blind to the danger escaped,
blind to everything except his own cruel shame
in dishonor. He kept sobbing convulsively, breaking
out at intervals into a fit of wild lamentation, which
pierced to the very entrails of Ali, who loved him as
his soul.</p>

<p>For fear lest troops should come and surprise
them, alone and unprotected, on the scene of riot, Ali
helped his suffering love to shelter in an archway farther
up the alley, and there ensconced him in the seat
of the sherbet seller, behind the stall of cooling drinks.
Removing a lemon which served as stopper to one of
the large bottles upon the board, he poured out drink
for his more than brother into a cup that was there,
in the hope to soothe him.</p>

<p>Nesìb took the cup, duteously; but, when he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
have sipped thereof, the tide of grief overcame him,
and he turned his face to the wall. The cup would
have fallen had not Ali caught it. The heartbroken
voice of the beloved cut his bones.</p>

<p>“O Allah, kill me. Have I not reached the nadir
of infamy? Are not my legs broken, both of them?
Was not my hand bit in two of a fat one? Did not
earth open and swallow me? Fell not the lot on me
that I should lose my horse? O Lord, have I not
borne enough already; but must the honor of my
house be defiled by infidels, breakers of faith, ravishers,
murderers? And now I have lost the knife I can
never replace—to no purpose, for it struck him not.
O Allah, avenge me quickly, or I die. Ah, woe!
woe! woe!”</p>

<p>Ali knelt beside the weeper. He took Nesìb’s
head upon his breast. Tender as a mother with her
sucking babe, he wiped the slaver from mustache and
beard; straightened the turban, smoothed the puckered
brow; weeping, he also, and saying:</p>

<p>“O the sin of them. May Allah destroy those
wicked ones who have brought such grief upon my
dear. But say not ‘I am helpless,’ while thou hast a
brother. Is not Ali whole? Are Ali’s two legs
broken? Is not all that pertains to Ali thine always
to command, employ? Has not Ali a knife, own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
brother to that thou didst throw? See, here; take,
examine it; it is thine!”</p>

<p>Nesìb’s limp fingers closed upon the knife, and in
gazing down at it his face straightened. He seemed
attracted by its flashing brilliance. But presently,
when Ali thought him comforted, his face knit once
more to weeping, and, with a moan, “I cannot stab
with it, but only throw it at a venture,” he pushed it
from him.</p>

<p>“O Allah, look on him. O Lord, punish the miscreants
who have made him thus,” cried Ali, beside
himself.</p>

<p>He caught up the knife and held it close under
the eyes of Nesìb, who had turned his face to
the sunlight, but saw nothing through the rain of
grief.</p>

<p>“See, I hold this knife—I, Ali, thy sworn
brother. The knife is thine, I am thy right arm. I
abide here with thee; I watch the alley. Whichever
comes, the black or his master, I slay with this knife,
the knife of Nesìb; with this arm, the arm of Nesìb;
in the name of Nesìb, under Allah. So shall thy
wrongs be avenged. Art content, O my eyes?”</p>

<p>Nesìb nodded, speechless. He grew calmer after
that. For minutes together he watched the sunny
lane with scarce a sob; but then the grief which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
gnawed his vitals would again assert itself, and Ali
would break forth again in imprecations, and renew
his oath of vengeance.</p>

<p>“See, I pull off my boots,” he said. “There
shall be no warning, no betraying footstep. The dog
shall fall suddenly as by the hand of Allah.”</p>

<p>He dragged off the homemade boots of goatskin,
which he wore for riding, and set them before Nesìb
to perfect assurance.</p>

<p>“Hush! One approaches. I hear the voice of
slippers.”</p>

<p>Peeping cautiously out, Ali drew back quickly.</p>

<p>“It is the black. He hastens. He has heard
of the tumult. Let us hide behind the stall a moment.
Quick, I help thee. Y’Allah! He is acquainted with
the sherbet seller.”</p>

<p>“I would fain see him,” whispered Nesìb, stifling
a sob.</p>

<p>The footsteps paused before the entry, the negro
looking for his old acquaintance, but they quickly
went on. Ali stole forth, crouching, swift and noiseless
as a leopard to the spring.</p>

<p>The Thief heard a gurgled cry, then three long
groans, ere Ali crept back out of the sunshine, and
placed in his hands the dagger, warm and wet.</p>

<p>Still sobbing a little, reminiscently, Nesìb took the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
dagger and surveyed it lovingly, stroking and fondling
it in his lap.</p>

<p>“It is finished. Art content, O beloved?”</p>

<p>“May thy goods increase, O Ali, O my dear
brother!” murmured the Thief, still gloating on the
bloody knife. Then, on a sudden prompting, he
stretched out his arms and caught Ali to his breast
in a passionate embrace.</p>

<p>It was Ali’s turn to weep convulsively. They
clung together, sobbing for joy in their mutual
devotion.</p>

<p>“Now let us go, O delight,” murmured Ali, at
length. “One beheld the deed. He was afar off and
he fled. It may be he will tell others.”</p>

<p>“I am ready,” replied the Thief, wiping the
dagger within the breast of his raiment.</p>

<p>Just then a woman’s shriek rent the air, giving
them pause. Ali whispered:</p>

<p>“They have found the dead pig. Wait a little,
O my soul. Let us once more hide behind the
stall.”</p>

<p>The sound of lamentation continued but a little
while. They heard a man’s voice give directions, followed
by the slam of a door. Then all was still.</p>

<p>A minute longer they crouched in hiding. Then
Ali helped his injured love to rise. Nesìb’s arm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
round Ali’s neck, Ali’s arm about Nesìb supporting
him, they emerged into the sunlight.</p>

<p>They had not accomplished many steps from their
retreat, when the sherbet seller, returning to his stall,
accosted them.</p>

<p>“A happy day, O my uncles! Saw you aught of
the great battle that was here awhile ago? Why
ask! Thy friend is injured. Ah, Allah knows the
wickedness of some people. A drink, now, flavored
of rose, or tamar-hind, or lemon, would refresh his
honor.” He ran to his stall and returned with a cup
and bottle. “Nay, take it as a gift; ennoble me.
The breeze has sprung up, but one feels it not just
here. I present the breeze and the shade of trees and
the bubbling waters. Do but sip, I entreat thee; it is
paradise.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

</div>

<p>From visiting his daughter’s grave, Shems-ud-dìn
sauntered round by the walls of the city till he came
to that rocky steep, at the top of which he had
preached to the negroes. He took a path that ran
down slantwise into the wady, and the embattled walls
were soon lost to sight. Mâs and Zeyd, the son of
Abbâs, followed him implicitly, though at a discreet
distance, and when at length he crossed his legs in the
shade of a little bluff, they took example from him
and did likewise.</p>

<p>The sheykh’s face was coldly serene as he gazed
on the sunburnt rocks, among which rose ancient
tombs strange of shape. He had sat there in peace
about an hour when a shout disturbed him. It fell
from the rocks above, and ruffled his countenance as
a stone the surface of a pool. Other shouts ensued.
He recognized the voice of Hassan, the laugh of
Shibli. Men came scrambling down the rocks. With
scarce an effort he admitted the call for patience, and
his brow smoothed again.</p>

<p>“Allah comfort thee, O sheykh,” cried the foremost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
of the Circassians. “May the wound to thy
soul be healed. May that treacherous Frank perish,
his house be burnt, his parents dishonored. Already
we have done something to avenge thee. In sh’ Allah,
we have made him quake a little.”</p>

<p>“I hear words of no meaning,” said Shems-ud-dìn,
who had risen. “What intend you by such
talk?”</p>

<p>Dismayed by the stern front opposed by their
saint to news they had deemed most welcome, the men
herded, silent and abashed, pending the arrival of
their chief who, being elderly and stiff at the joints,
used caution in the descent from rock to rock. At
length Hassan, breathless, slid down among them.</p>

<p>“O beloved, how great the grief. How I sorrow
with thee,” he exclaimed in accents of condolence.
“By Allah, it seems ten years since last I
saw thee.”</p>

<p>“It is in truth some days, and thou art welcome,
O my dear. But say, what is this of which thy companions
prate—some outrage done to the hakìm, my
benefactor?” Shems-ud-dìn stood erect, severely
questioning. His eyes met Hassan’s steadily.</p>

<p>The Guardian of the Frontier hung his head as
at the Last Day. But soon recovering, he told the
story of the riot, representing it as a game, a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
pleasantry at the expense of one who had deserved
much worse at their hands; for had he not obtained
their presents by a false pretense?</p>

<p>“As for naming him thy benefactor, O scion of
a noble house, I grieve to hear thee thus exalt the dirt
beneath thee. Hast thou not paid him as though
he had performed his covenant? Surely he is thy
debtor. Remains the affront to thee and all of us
here.”</p>

<p>“I laugh for pity,” said Shems-ud-dìn, with a
fleeting smile. “In the case of some other than
myself, I might laugh with amusement, for the thing
is ludicrous. Is it not a stock expedient with the
provokers of mirth to throw the punishment for crime
upon some good man and simple, most innocent
thereof? I alone have sinned, and lo! you visit my
sin upon this physician, whose fault has been excess
of kindness. Shall I not own obligation? I offered
the half of my fortune; I struck no bargain with him
beforehand; he could have claimed the half of me.
Yet, when it came to the reckoning, he asked but his
just due, and named all the items in account. Which
of you, in his place, would have dealt so gently with
a stranger?</p>

<p>“You assail his house, assault, affright him. By
what right, I demand to know? Are you, and not I,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
in account with him? Hear the words of Allah. You
know the korân, ‘He that shall err, shall err only for
his own soul, nor shall any laden be charged with
another’s burden’; and again, ‘The fate of every
man is tied about his neck.’ By what right, then, do
you meddle with the things which concern me only?
Is your sympathy for me so great that, seeing I have
sinned, you must sin yourselves more abominably?...
Go, O Zeyd. Speed to the house of that worthy
infidel. Express to him my regret for the disturbance
caused to his house by these, my too ardent sympathizers.”</p>

<p>“Ready, O my master.” Zeyd moved to obey,
but laggingly, and with the mien of one much loath.
For Zeyd prized the eloquence of Shems-ud-dìn above
all jewels. The fine words, accurately pronounced by
the scholar, sang of love to his soul, which languished
as a bride expectant. And never had Shems-ud-dìn
spoken as now he spoke, with such authority, such inspiration
in the choice of fitting words. Zeyd grudged
that feast to the Circassians, to Mâs, to fickle Shibli.
He alone could quite appreciate it; and he must go.
He went very slowly.</p>

<p>The other listeners, disconcerted by the attitude
of their saint, still more by an unwonted smile which
flickered round his lips, had not a word to reply. Sarcasm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
was a weapon they all feared, and it was the
weapon least expected from so mild a man. But what
they took for sarcasm in this instance was, in truth,
but the natural expression of one new-weaned from
earthly longing, whose mind now dwelt with Allah
and beheld the things of earth from an immeasurable
height.</p>

<p>He went on to speak to them of his own sin, quoting,
“Man prays for evil, as he prays for good, for
man is unthinking”; when all personal feelings became
lost in pure admiration of his golden gift. His
language grew so refined, his mind soared so near to
heaven, that they, his hearers, could only gasp and
praise the Lord.</p>

<p>“Hear the supreme khatìb. O my soul, the
heavenly preacher,” panted one and another.</p>

<p>All at once there burst a sobbing cry from out the
rocks above, the cry of one at the pang of sensual
enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Ah, ah! his lips are gold. Gems shower
from them. O my eyes! O Allah One and Unaccompanied!”</p>

<p>The preacher paused and glanced upward. A
disreputable tarbûsh, garnished with a dirty rag by
way of turban, peeped above a neighboring crag.</p>

<p>“O Zeyd,” cried the sheykh severely, “art thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
not sped then? Since it irks thee to do my bidding,
Mâs goes instead of thee.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I go, O my lord.” The face and shoulders,
half the form of Zeyd, popped up very suddenly.
“But oh, what words! What treasure! O
blessed day!” He was seen to scale the rocks with
alacrity.</p>

<p>His master smiled; and even in the moment of
displeasure there had been that about his mouth and
in his eyes which showed that the mind despised its
own vexation.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn continued to speak of sin, and
the need of good works, and of the judgment,
when a book shall be given to each of the sons of
men wherein he shall read his own account for good
or evil.</p>

<p>The sun of noon burned overhead, yet none
stirred to escape its rays. Above the wady, a gash in
the rugged landscape, a hawk hovered, seeming motionless.
Faint sounds came wafted from a village on
the yonder steep, of one color with the rocks to which
it clung.</p>

<p>At length a growth of noise above them excited
curiosity. Some of the circle rose and scanned the
height.</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah!” cried Hassan. “A bird must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
have carried the fame of thy discourse into the city,
O beloved, for much people watch us from the rocks.”</p>

<p>“Allah! What was it flashed there, behind that
stone?”</p>

<p>“By the Korân, there are men all about us,
moving secretly.”</p>

<p>Hassan Agha tugged at his white mustache.</p>

<p>“Let us be walking,” he commanded. “Show
no concern, my children, nor fight, for the foe is
numerous. With thy leave, O beloved, we will return
to the city together.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn, undismayed, took the hand held
out to him, and walked with his old friend slowly
along the path which wound upward among the rocks.</p>

<p>“Stand, all of you.”</p>

<p>From beside an ancient tomb two soldiers stood
forth suddenly, barring the way. At that Hassan
railed:</p>

<p>“What ails you, O my dears? Has the sun
addled your wits that you venture to command this
holy man, a great one, no less than brother to the renowned
Milhem Pasha, whom Allah preserve.”</p>

<p>Soldiers were now all about them, joking good-naturedly.
There had been no resistance, and they
were grateful, for it was very hot.</p>

<p>“Allah witness how I grieve for you,” laughed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
one in whom Hassan recognized the Bimbashi Muhammed.
“But to sift the innocent from the guilty
is not our business. That belongs to the judge; let
him see to it. By Allah, thou art out of luck, old fox.
This is no jesting matter like ours of the other night.”</p>

<p>The man held his tongue, for a superior officer
now approached them, scrambling up from below.
Hassan scanned the features of the newcomer eagerly,
but sighed; it was not Abd-ur-Rahman.</p>

<p>“With what are we charged?” he inquired, scorn
born of indignation making the words a sword thrust.</p>

<p>“By my life, I know not for certain,” came the
light rejoinder. “There is talk of a riot and a man
slain, an old negro, the slave of a Jew of some sort,
who is an English subject. It is a word from the English
consul that has fluttered the Mutesarrif; we do
not move so quickly in the cause of true belief. A sin,
as my brother—who is religious—rightly says. But
what would you? The infidels—Jew and Christian—outnumber
us here in the proportion of ten to one;
and they have strong and unscrupulous protectors in
the Powers of Europe. To keep the mastery we must
sometimes throw a crumb. May Allah cleanse you
of the charge.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn heard these words and many others;
but their purport remained vague to him. He perceived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
only, and with a species of exultation, that he
was called upon to exhibit that strength in resignation
which now informed his whole being. On the broad
road, beneath the echoing gate, in the rough-paved
streets, he heard the murmur of a crowd, restless, inquisitive.
Here it surrounded them, there dropped
behind. Of a sudden, in a sunless place, a man cried
suddenly:</p>

<p>“O Hassan Agha! O holy Shems-ud-dìn! O
Allah most high! What thing do we behold?” The
voice went along with them, shouting questions, till
at length it fawned in entreaty. “O lords of kindness!
O soldiers brave and good! Take us also, for
the crime is ours.”</p>

<p>“Since thou and thy friend desire the scourge, the
prison, even death, perhaps, who am I to gainsay thee,
O father of two bad legs?” laughed the captain of
the guard; and Nesìb the Thief, sustained of Ali,
came in among them.</p>

<p>At the door of the Mehkemeh, several of the
curious slipped in with the prisoners, for these were
too plentiful for the soldiers to keep strict count,
though the trial was ordered to be secret.</p>

<p>The hall, murmurous with their voices, struck
dark on Shems-ud-dìn. It was some time ere he could
see the likeness of the judge; but at length he discerned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
a fat man seated in apparent dejection upon
a dais, a scribe before him, and on his right hand one
but little leaner, who wore Frankish clothes beneath
his fez, and appeared in the best of spirits—a servant
of the English consul, it was whispered.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

</div>

<p>Yûsuf Effendi, Câdi of El Cûds, was sullen
and discontented, in the mood to strike his best friend.
An hour ago a scribbled note from the Mutesarrif
had dashed the complacency with which he sat listening
to a case of fraud between a Jew and a Greek,
having garnered more than the sum sued for in bribes
from either party. The court had to be cleared,
judgment given hastily, when he loved deliberation
and the dainty quibbling of the pleaders before him.
Other cases, no less profitable, had to be adjourned—rich
plaintiffs and defendants driven forth with the
money in their hands; and all in favor of a cause
prejudged by his superior—a political cause for which
no gifts could be received, no advocates employed—at
the behest of an unclean beast, the English
consul.</p>

<p>“It is imperative that the delinquents die ere sunset.
Make some show of trial. Shut the door.”</p>

<p>There was no evading the clear orders of one on
whose will he depended for rank and honor. Yet he
would fain have shirked the responsibility, for in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
fat and easy way he feared God. Though he received
gifts, of course, from all and sundry, in giving judgment
he knew no influence save the rights of the case.</p>

<p>He was no roving, conscienceless official to level
foul with clean, but a man of fixed abode and consequent
respectability, who, though urbane in his dealings
with the infidels, esteemed them no more than
dogs in his way to business. This charge to do the
dirty work of a Frank humiliated him. It galled his
pride, also, to have to endure the familiarity and regard
the hints of a low-born Christian of his own city,
who actually had the impudence to sit at his right
hand, in the place of honor. Yûsuf would fain have
invoked the Mûfti, as usual in cases of religious difference;
but, knowing the anxiety of the governor that
the trial should be hid especially from the mosque
authorities, he dared not do so. He groaned in
soul:</p>

<p>“O day of evil! Is it not enough that I, who had
ever enjoyed the security which belongs to respect,
have been robbed of my rents, stripped, and foully insulted
within this week? Must I afterwards jeopardize
my salvation at the call of the wicked?”</p>

<p>The inflow of so many prisoners as almost to fill
the hall caused the judge to discern faint rays of hope.
It could be necessary to condemn only a few of them;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
and the rest, in the rapture of escape, might well make
thank offerings to their preserver.</p>

<p>He turned from converse with the noisome beast
beside him to whisper in his scribe’s ear:</p>

<p>“Write: How many are to die? and address to
his Highness the Mutesarrif.”</p>

<p>The scribe straightway wrote as commanded,
while the Nazarene, sweetly smiling, craned his neck
in a vain attempt to spy what was written. The note
was given to an attendant who, crying, “Oäh!
Oäh!” pushed his way to the door.</p>

<p>Then, having enjoined silence, Yûsuf began to
harangue the multitude, without looking, in a manner
of abstract reprobation, heedless of the impatience
of the consul’s representative and the rising murmur
in the court, until an answer was received; when he
took breath just long enough to decipher:</p>

<p>“As many as you judge fit. The wild beast is
bloodthirsty—a danger unless we glut him. At sight
of this, tear up.”</p>

<p>Upon that, in a few words, he closed his lecture
on jurisprudence, which had served its turn.</p>

<p>“In mercy let the trial now begin,” murmured the
Offense at his side pointedly.</p>

<p>“Interrupt not, I beseech thee,” rejoined Yûsuf,
giving sting for sting. He could not look upon those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
true believers he was doomed to wrong. Shame
dropped a curtain at the edge of the dais. With eyes
downcast upon a chaplet with which his hands kept
toying, he asked, “Who accuses?”</p>

<p>“I am he,” returned the Christian; “on behalf
of the illustrious consul of Her Britannic Majesty,
and as representing one Jurjus Mekkuswell, a missionary
doctor, who is a British subject.”</p>

<p>“Against whom, and of what nature, the accusation?”</p>

<p>“Against divers Circassians, colonists, from Jebel
Ajlûn, for attacking the house of the hakìm and
murdering one Ismaìl, his servant. But principally
against the Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn El Attâr, likewise
from Jebel Ajlûn, who instigated the said attack, the
said murder.”</p>

<p>“The Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn El Attâr, is he present
in the court?” cried the judge, without looking
up from his beads.</p>

<p>“Present,” answered a full, clear voice.</p>

<p>“Are there any Circassians present in the court?”</p>

<p>“No need to ask, O lord! The court is full of
them,” murmured the scribe at his feet.</p>

<p>“It is well. The accused are before us. Let the
English hakìm testify against them.”</p>

<p>At that the Christian showed annoyance, calling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
the demand vexatious, unnecessary. The hakìm had
made deposition before the consul, which was quite
sufficient. Naturally, after the outrages committed
against him, he was not calm enough to appear in public.
To what purpose on earth should he come? The
crime was indisputable, for it was the talk of the
whole city. And the prisoners had made themselves
so notorious on former occasions, that any lad out of
the street could identify them.</p>

<p>The Câdi appeared dissatisfied with the representations
of his loathsome colleague. He would not
submit without a wrangle. But at length, after prolonged
whisperings, he said aloud:</p>

<p>“Good. Then what witness have you?”</p>

<p>“We have a capital witness—none like him!—a
certain vender of cooling drinks, who saw all that
befell. He has been examined already before the consul,
but is now in this court, at your Excellency’s
pleasure. His name is Mûsa. If it please you,
hear him.”</p>

<p>“Call Mûsa the sherbet seller,” murmured the
Câdi wearily; and “Mûsa the sherbet seller” was
called on every hand.</p>

<p>A Muslim of middle age pushed forward through
the crowd. He bent double before the dais.</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey, O majesty!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>“Do thou interrogate him, O khawâjah,” said
the Câdi bitingly. “Thou, it seems, art conducting
this trial.”</p>

<p>“Allah forbid that I should usurp any function
of your Grace!” murmured the supple Christian.
Nevertheless he proceeded to question the witness,
while the judge told his beads sulkily, never lifting
his eyes.</p>

<p>Did the witness recognize among the men in court
a certain sheykh who had been wont to go often to
the house of the English physician, for the reason
that his sick daughter lay there?</p>

<p>Most certainly he did, and was glad to see
the excellent man in life and health, after the
grievous blow he had sustained in the loss of his
daughter.</p>

<p>It was not the answer required by the consul’s
delegate; but he swallowed his disconcertion and
proceeded.</p>

<p>“What kind of a man did the witness consider
him to be?”</p>

<p>“The very best kind of man. No less than a
saint, by Allah.”</p>

<p>Stung by a cackling noise in the throat of the
judge, the Nazarene thundered:</p>

<p>“O lying dog! Thou didst tell another tale to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
the consul’s excellency. Thou hast made oath that he
was concerned in the riot.”</p>

<p>“No, no, by thy leave, O dear lord; I said not
that he knew aught of the riot, but that they who
made the tumult might have been his companions.”</p>

<p>“Are they here present, those rioters?”</p>

<p>“Allah knows! In so great a crowd there may
be some of them. But my eyes see some who are very
certainly innocent. That man there, who leans upon
his neighbor, is one of the victims, having both his
legs injured in the battle. I know well, for he is a
customer of mine and refreshed himself at my stall
afterwards. And the Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn, he is very
innocent; and the negro Mâs, his servant——”</p>

<p>“Liar! Dolt! Madman! He is the chief
offender, that Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn! Get thee gone,
O perjured wretch! May Allah destroy thee!”
The Christian turned from denouncing the recreant
to murmur suavely in the Câdi’s ear, “It is my error.
This witness ought to have been examined privately.
He dares not to speak truth in the hearing of
the prisoners for fear of vengeance, since they all
know him.”</p>

<p>“What? Is it finished already? Have you no
other witness?” Again that strange sound was
heard in the throat of the judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“No, O Excellency; but the charge is clear,
the case proven beforehand. Wilt thou not give
judgment?”</p>

<p>Yûsuf Effendi feigned not to hear the suggestion.
Since it was God’s will that he, the Câdi of El Cûds,
should be chained to an ape, the shackles should not
gall him only. The monkey, too, must feel them on
the raw. There were yet some hours till sunset.</p>

<p>“It behooves first to hear the defense,” he said
languidly; and then sat in silence for some minutes.</p>

<p>Peace had fallen on the court. The prisoners
and their guards, tired of standing, all sat now upon
the floor.</p>

<p>At length the Câdi, still intent on his beads, murmured
sleepily:</p>

<p>“Who is chief among you reprobates, let him
speak.”</p>

<p>At that there arose some whispered debate among
the accused, as though to adjust the preëminence.
But soon a clear voice uttered:</p>

<p>“O Excellency, what can be said? I am an old
man, and my life is of small account. If one here
must die, be mine the lot, and let all these go free. It
is the will of Allah, unto Allah praise! Is it not better
for a man to die being innocent than being guilty?
For Allah is just and compassionate; He will correct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
the balance. But thou, O my son, consider, I beseech
thee, how heinous thy sin is! Thy mind is bent, not
to minister justice, but to slay. Thou hast not even
recited the charge against me. The hand of the infidel
is well seen in thy behavior. A tempter grins at
thy right ear. Beware, O judge, how thou pervert
judgment; for thyself shalt be judged and shalt
wander blind at the Last Day!”</p>

<p>Yûsuf did not look up nor cease from telling his
beads. He said irritably:</p>

<p>“Shall the caitiff rebuke his judge? Smite his
mouth some of you!... Let a second now speak,
and see that he be not insolent.”</p>

<p>This time a rougher voice, using the speech of the
common soldiers with an accent like the Turkish,
declaimed:</p>

<p>“O most Excellent, I am a Circassian, chief of
those who migrated to this land years ago from the
yoke of the Muscovite. The Sultàn Abdul Mejìd
named me Guardian of the Frontier by express
firmàn. Great honor had we in those days, I and my
companions, both at Istanbûl the mighty and on arrival
in this land. Then men vied one with another
in kindness toward us. Power stood by us like a
sworn brother. But to-day all is changed. No man
regards us any more. I have served the Sultàn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
faithfully at my post these many years. I have swept
back the Bedû from the borders of this province, as
one strikes the dust off a friend’s robe. I have furthered
every effort of the government. And for what
reward? To be denied a few rifles, a sufficiency of
ammunition, by your garrison. To be treated worse
than you treat the beggar in your gates. To be haled
before your Grace this day upon a charge I comprehend
not!</p>

<p>“Truly the faith of those in authority is but for
a day, and their obligation but as shifting sand. Let
none deceive himself to think it lasting, lest he stand
as I stand now, ashamed in his old age.”</p>

<p>Overcome with emotion, the speaker paused; to
resume shortly:</p>

<p>“What would be said of a man who thus used his
servant? Now I care not though we die, I and my
companions, for death is not more bitter than has
been our undeceiving. We have sinned oft and
grievously, and it may be we deserve to die. But put
to death the upright and illustrious Shems-ud-dìn,
that friend of all the learned, dear to Allah, and may
all thy bones rot painfully joint by joint! May all
men spew at sight of thee! May thy children——”</p>

<p>A mighty uproar drowned the curse. The whole
court rose as one man. The Câdi bounced to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
feet, mouthing, gesticulating, a-tremble with rage and
terror.</p>

<p>“Dog!” he yelled. “Be silent, madman!
Pluck his tongue out, scourge him, flay him! Ho,
you soldiers! Is it fear holds you there idle?”</p>

<p>At the taunt a dozen soldiers ran and seized on
Hassan, who had stood his ground defiantly.</p>

<p>Not until the wretch was clearly powerless did
Yûsuf Effendi venture to meet his eyes. The effect of
that glance was magical. The fat and sleepy Câdi
turned a maniac. He shrieked and shrieked again, in
convulsions as if his robe had been poisoned.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

</div>

<p>“They are impostors, robbers, murderers. They
shall die, every one of them. They robbed me—me,
the Câdi—of the moneys I had collected from my
lands. Two of them. Two devils! I hold one:
where is his brother? Aha, I see him. He skulks
yonder. Bring forward that man of the thick beard—he
who stoops behind the tall one. Bring him
hither to beside his fellow. Hold fast his arms.”</p>

<p>Nesìb, the Thief, was dragged to the foot of the
dais. He screamed for the pain such rough usage inflicted
on his wounded legs; while Ali, withheld from
following him, screamed yet more lustily. When the
judge stooped down and deliberately spat in his face,
Nesìb’s screams increased to a very death shriek,
which was echoed of Ali in the crowd behind.</p>

<p>“O Allah! O crown of infamy! He bit my
wrist, and now he spits on me. O woe! woe!”</p>

<p>Hassan Agha, subjected to the same insult, only
sneered and craved the freedom of one hand to wipe
his face, which was denied him.</p>

<p>Somewhat allayed by this ceremony, the wrath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
of the judge put on the garb of reason. He had no
longer the slightest compunction in sentencing those
Muslims to a shameful death.</p>

<p>“In the name of Allah, you deserve to die, all of
you. For not one misdeed, but a thousand are
proved against you. These two men here before me,
for their more abominable crimes, shall be strangled
and left unburied. On the rest of you I have mercy:
they will be shot. Subject to the will of the Mutesarrif,
our Sultàn’s shadow on this land—whom may
Allah preserve. In the name of Allah, gracious,
compassionate, it is decreed.”</p>

<p>At that went up a bitter cry from all the multitude,
but especially from those inquisitives who for
pastime had thrust their way into the court. In hopes
to save their comrades and one another, Nesìb and
Ali each yelled his confession of guilt. But the
uproar sufficed to drown individual voices. Curses,
lamentations, prayers, mingled discordantly, while
the soldiers struck here and there at the noisiest, felling
some of them and fetching blood from mouths
and noses. The hall of judgment wore the aspect
of a shambles. From the dais beside the judge,
the plump and smiling Christian gloated on the
scene.</p>

<p>The disorder was at its height when a door at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
back of the hall opened, letting in a ray of sunlight
upon the hindmost of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Shut the door,” shrieked the Câdi, in sudden
terror.</p>

<p>Instantly he was obeyed. But some one had entered.
The soldiers, saluting, cleared a way for Abd-ur-Rahman
Bey to the foot of the dais.</p>

<p>The face of the young man was haggard and
hard set. At glad cries of his own name, he glanced
this way and that unseeingly.</p>

<p>“Abd-ur-Rahman! It is himself—Abd-ur-Rahman.
O son, preserve thy father. Save thy friends.”</p>

<p>He stepped upon the dais and, totally disregarding
the cringe of the consul’s dragoman, addressed
the judge without a compliment:</p>

<p>“What is this, O Effendi? Why these cries to me
for help? Surely one of thy discrimination has perceived
that these men are guiltless of the crime imputed
to them?”</p>

<p>“By what right, O my eyes, dost thou use this
tone with me?” snapped the Câdi angrily, darting an
uneasy glance at the besetting Nazarene. “These
men are guilty of riot and bloodshed, violent robbery
and rebellion. They die, and their doom is righteous.
It is my last word.”</p>

<p>“Then it is a bad day for thee, O my dear. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
know that among these men is my father, a reverend
and most learned sheykh of the religion, whose death
all Islâm will deplore. He is, moreover, the beloved
brother of Milhem Pasha whose power, as thou knowest,
is considerable. And further, these Circassians
are under direct protection of the government, as can
be proved by a reference to the archives. My uncle
Milhem Pasha knows this and has procured renewal
of the firmàn concerning them. But yesterday he informed
me in writing that a grant of new rifles will
shortly be made to them, and in the same letter
named them his friends. Reflect a little, I entreat
thee, O my soul.”</p>

<p>The confidence of Yûsuf staggered. For the moment
he knew not what to murmur, where to look.
The chief of those soldiers who herded the prisoners
came to his relief, laughing:</p>

<p>“Believe him not, Yûsuf. It is a generous lie to
save these poor people whom he knew of old. And
really, in thy place, I would spare the most of them.
More than once have I heard him deny the truth of
a report which made yon old man his father.”</p>

<p>“Nay, it was then that I lied,” cried Abd-ur-Rahman,
as if in pain. “I was ashamed of one so poor
in seeming, so old-fashioned, so simply pious. So I
lied—mad that I was!—and denied my father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>“Then wert thou dirt, a thing to spit on. But
praise to Allah, I believe thee not,” said the officer,
turning on his heel.</p>

<p>“It is that, thou liest to save them,” said the Câdi,
with restored confidence.</p>

<p>Then Abd-ur-Rahman called God to witness. He
threatened, entreated, reasoned, all in vain.</p>

<p>Still “It is hard to believe,” shrugged the Câdi,
smiling.</p>

<p>“The men are already condemned. It is clearly
proved against them,” said the Nazarene, at his ear,
as a needed reminder.</p>

<p>“Then it is the worse for thee, O Yûsuf Effendi,”
cried Abd-ur-Rahman, in a fury. “I go hence to the
French telegraph; and if before the sun sets, the
wrath of Milhem Pasha is not loosed against all
the Mutesarrifate of El Cûds, may Allah strike me
dead this minute.”</p>

<p>With that and a moan, “O my father!” he
pushed his way out. Once more the door opened, admitting
a sunbeam, then closed again. A hush was
on the seated crowd. The Câdi returned to his beads
for countenance, his downcast face in the shadow of
a great perplexity. The cheerful Christian whispered
at his ear:</p>

<p>“Had that old man been in truth his father,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
would he not have run and embraced him? Not once
did he look toward him, for I observed closely.
Moreover, this sheykh resembles not in the least a
man learned and of a good house.”</p>

<p>For the first time cordial with his vile associate,
Yûsuf agreed.</p>

<p>“By Allah, the right is with thee. But who is
this Milhem Pasha? His name is known to me.
What is his exact position at this day?”</p>

<p>“Who knows? Doubtless he is a pasha like
another. Every youth cries up his own house.”</p>

<p>Still the Câdi was ill at ease. He dared not dismiss
the prisoners for execution, yet had nothing more
to say to them, having given sentence. He desired
earnestly to be rid of the spy at his side, who crippled
him with a sense of undesirable publicity.</p>

<p>Seeing the beast yawn and look sleepy, he begged
him with all customary blessings to retire and seek
repose. The trial was ended, the doom pronounced.
The rest consisted in a few formalities unworthy
of his assistance. He or his Excellency the consul
could come after sunset to the Tower to see the
bodies.</p>

<p>The Christian did not need much persuasion. He
had fulfilled the commands of his lord and was very
sleepy. Yûsuf Effendi bowed low with a profusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
of blessings, which changed to as great a profusion
of curses when he was gone.</p>

<p>To refresh his wits, he then bade the scribe make
coffee, for which all necessaries were at hand. He
lighted a cigarette and smoked it pensively, still toying
with his chaplet. The prisoners, thankful for a
respite, sat in groups upon the floor, exchanging
cigarettes with their guards, smoking, and chatting
together very peacefully. Only Shems-ud-dìn kept
aloof with Mâs the negro. He missed but one thing,
to grieve for it, and that was the soiled headgear and
old striped cloak of Zeyd ebn Abbâs. The whole succession
of events and characters—judge and sentence,
soldiers and prisoners, the coming and going of his
only son—made but a speck on his mind, where it
floated like a tiny boat that frets upon a great
calm sea.</p>

<p>At length, after two cups of coffee, Yûsuf whispered
to his scribe:</p>

<p>“Write to the Mutesarrif, asking of what rank,
what influence is Milhem Pasha, uncle to the young
Abd-ur-Rahman? Add, for his Excellency’s guidance,
that the question concerns the trial.”</p>

<p>The note dispatched, he sat inactive, looking
down at his beads, till came the answer:</p>

<p>“Since two days he is Grand Wazìr; I have the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
news this hour from a private source. If the culprits
are under his protection, kill anyone else in the world,
but spare them, or thou art ruined, I with thee. Let
no eye behold this writing.”</p>

<p>All things swam before the Câdi’s eyes. Had
Abd-ur-Rahman spoken truth, he was indeed in a nice
dilemma.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h2>

</div>

<p>Scourged by his master’s mild reproof of him
for loitering, Zeyd needed no second reminder to
make haste. With the bounds of a goat he scaled the
rocks and ran along by the foot of the city wall. The
noble words which had enthralled him to forget duty
boomed in his brain, making earth heaven, wrapping
him in a cloud of gorgeous imagery. As he neared
the gate, a band of soldiers marched out silently, attended
by a little horde of ragamuffin Jews and Christians.
The arrow of the sheykh, he scarce perceived
them, intent only upon the will of his master, to do
which was in itself a rapture. He measured not his
pace on such an errand, and it was with surprise, when
nearing the house of the Frank physician, that he
found sweat streaming from every pore.</p>

<p>He knocked thrice before anyone answered, and
then it was not Ismaìl’s voice, but that of the serving
maid, which smote his ear:</p>

<p>“Who is there? What would you?”</p>

<p>“It is I, Zeyd ebn Abbâs, having an errand to the
khawâjah.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>“Art thou alone out there? Is it sure there are
none beside thee?”</p>

<p>“By Allah, it is sure. Who else on earth should
there be?”</p>

<p>“Then enter and behold the work of thy master.
O day of my grief! O wicked day!... The hakìm
is not in the house. It is now two hours since he went
forth. Allah grant they have not killed him also, the
wicked ones!”</p>

<p>Thus lamenting, she let Zeyd in. He dared not,
for his soul’s weal, glance at her unveiled face. Her
sobs and reproaches vexed him. They called for retort,
but he dared not parley with the mistress of so
great attractions.</p>

<p>“Y’Allah! Come and see what thy master has
done for us, his benefactors! The hakìm will soon
return, in sh’ Allah, and then thou shalt hear truth
for once in life. It is two hours since he went out
to the house of the consul. Aha, a proper vengeance
shall overtake thee and thy master and all thy race
of dogs!”</p>

<p>She dragged him through into the court. She had
the strength of a jinni. Her clutch rent his clothing,
which had been ragged enough before. Yet he dared
not offer resistance lest, at touch of her, desire should
master him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>A second voice of woe assailed his ears. It came
from the shadowed side of the yard, from out a vault,
of which the door stood open.</p>

<p>“Go in! Look!” shrieked his conductor, dragging
him to that doorway.</p>

<p>Zeyd strove after the superior smile of one who
humors a madwoman, but his look changed quickly
to horror and his hands flew up. There, within, upon
a low couch, lay the form of Ismaìl the doorkeeper,
stiff in death, the face fixed in a travesty of its wonted
kindly grin. The brow seemed to have shrunk away
from beneath the turban, the cheeks had sunken; the
white beard seemed a growth independent of the chin
it fastened on. It was no longer the man, simple yet
so wise, whom Zeyd had known and revered, but
something derisive, harsh, and terrible, a menace and
a curse.</p>

<p>Beside the corpse lay Fatmeh on her face, weeping
bitterly. The girl who had admitted Zeyd pushed
past him and kicked the prostrate one again and
again, then, kneeling, beat and pinched her unmercifully,
screaming:</p>

<p>“Weep! Weep! By the Gospel, I will make
thee weep, O cause of misfortune to the house that
sheltered thee. Foul daughter of a Muslim, weep
louder, louder! Oh, if all you Muslimûn were made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
on the pattern of him who lies there, then earth would
be a different place! Cease not to weep, lest I tear
thy eyes.”</p>

<p>In the frenzy of her spite, she had forgotten Zeyd.
When he flung her back by main force, she looked on
him with blind eyes a moment. Then with the hiss
of an angry serpent she strove to scratch his eyes, spitting
venomously.</p>

<p>“May Allah blind and maim thee! All shall die—thou
and thy wicked sheykh, and this woman, and,
the rest of you—all—all! My lord went to the
consul—the consul, hear you? And the end of all
of you is concerted, if not accomplished.... Ah,
devil! What wouldst thou? Let go; let go, I say!
O Allah! O Blessed Lord!”</p>

<p>Anger had driven from Zeyd’s mind every
thought of goodness. He saw only the charms of the
woman, remembered only her brutality to Fatmeh,
and the affronts she had put upon himself. With
clenched teeth and blazing eyes, he was working to
master her when the voice of the Frank called without.
In the same minute she ceased struggling and
he let go.</p>

<p>Then, too late, Zeyd remembered that he had
come on an errand of apology; and he hung his head.
Was he himself any better than the Circassians?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
Truly, a man uninspired was no more master of his
own impulses than is a sword in a strong hand. Crestfallen
and ashamed, Zeyd went and humbled himself
before the physician. He tried to give his message.
But the unbeliever would not listen, making
moan in his own fashion, which was not that of
the son of an Arab, with gestures and a bitter
cry, but simply a sardonic grinning and muttering,
the while his hands trembled, clasped and unclasped
nervously.</p>

<p>“Begone! Walk! Go out of my house! Have
I not seen enough of thee and thy master? A good
return—is it not?—for all I did for the girl. He
brings the city against me. He kills my doorkeeper,
the best of men. He shall be severely punished, word
of an Englishman! The consul says so. But as for
me, I lose my appointment. The society will not
retain me after all this. I have to thank thy master
for much—very much. I think so indeed. He is a
good man, not so? Excellent! Ah, ha, ha!...
Speak not! Begone! Walk! And take the woman
with thee. Let me see the end of all of you!”</p>

<p>There was no reasoning with a creature so
plainly distraught. “Begone!” he kept repeating,
till at last Zeyd renounced all further attempt to
pierce his understanding and said, a little irritably:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>“To hear is to obey.”</p>

<p>Zeyd went back into the death chamber, murmured
“Peace to the upright!” by the corpse of the
kind old negro, and taking Fatmeh by the hand raised
her and led her forth. By the outer door of the house
stood the weeping maidservant. She opened for
them and, as they passed out, struck Fatmeh such
a blow beneath the shoulders that she groaned and
fell forward, coughing violently. Zeyd thought her
stabbed. He turned to take vengeance, but the door
was shut.</p>

<p>Fatmeh lay upon the cobbles of the narrow lane,
groaning and coughing by turns; while Zeyd raised
hands of denunciation against that house of sin, calling
to Allah for justice upon her murderers. No
help, no human form, was at hand. The accustomed
seat of the sherbet seller was empty.</p>

<p>Soon, however, to his vast relief, Fatmeh rose up,
expressing her readiness, and he led her to the khan.</p>

<p>It was the heat of the day when no one fares
abroad who can help it. Those they met were too
indolent to take note of the tousled raiment of a
woman or the mad mutterings of a man, who at a
glance seemed mere beggars.</p>

<p>On arrival at the khan the host put many anxious
questions to them out of the kindness of his heart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
He was more than repaid by the thrill of Zeyd’s
narrative.</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah!” he exclaimed at the end. “It
is not good to frequent unbelievers. The sheykh—dear,
righteous man!—he thought no evil—that is
known. And yet it was not good. I myself could
have informed him harm would come of it.”</p>

<p>He readily undertook to lodge Fatmeh with his
own women.</p>

<p>While they yet stood talking in the doorway, an
ass, saddled and bridled, was led out from the adjoining
stable. It was followed by an aged fellâh, who
gave a coin to the hostler. The fellâh then bestrode
the beast, groaning like a camel with the exertion.
Zeyd, recognizing his wife’s sister’s husband’s uncle,
hailed him joyfully.</p>

<p>“I cannot stay. I have waited long enough,”
muttered the donkey rider, in agitation. “Allah
knows they may be already at my house, clasping my
doorposts, needing my protection. I am old and have
no stomach for the fray. Yet they went off bravely,
that handful against a whole city. I was proud of
their friendship though I slipped away. No doubt
but that they have slain the Frank and all belonging
to him, and have destroyed his house with fire. They
come from wilds wherein vengeance is a sacred right—as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
it should be, O my son—as it should be. They
know not the law of this city which takes no count of
religious motives. They will flee from the punishment
to my house, and I must be there to shield them
if I can.”</p>

<p>“Was the riot then so serious, O my uncle?
They spoke of it as a jest.”</p>

<p>“Hadst thou seen their faces, heard their heartsome
shouts as I did, thou wouldst never ask—‘was it
serious?’”</p>

<p>“Alas, for their wickedness. Very surely they
are the worst of men. May Allah destroy the house
of every one of them.”</p>

<p>The fellâh contradicted Zeyd hotly: “Nay, may
Allah prosper them. Art thou, then, also their enemy?
Blessed guests have they been to our village.
The fame of them has made us respected in all the
neighborhood. They are good—the best possible—to
their friends. What matter though they be
bad to their enemies? Can all men use the same
eyes? May Allah preserve them. In thy grace,
O my dear!”</p>

<p>Pressed by the old man’s heels, the donkey
started, its shod hoofs waking echoes in that deep-walled
place.</p>

<p>Zeyd followed, in search of the Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
for whose safety he grew anxious. Talking
of danger and punishment had brought into the foreground
of his remembrance details which had failed
to impress him at the time—in particular, the company
of soldiers which had passed him by the city
gate, and the confusion in the Frank’s mad speech of
Shems-ud-dìn with the Circassians. Apprehensions,
spurred by indigestion of the various insults he had
been forced to stomach, made his soul groan within
him. At unawares he ran instead of walked—a
strange sight in the city at high noon.</p>

<p>At length he stopped to inquire of a group of
good Muslims standing gossiping before a cobbler’s
stall, whether anyone had seen the Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn
and his unmistakable adherents. The men turned
from their questioner to glance meaningly one at
another. The cobbler it was who answered.</p>

<p>“W’ Allah!” he exclaimed, pausing, needle in
air, from his sewing at a certain slipper. “Go and
ask at the Mehkemeh. A hundred Muslimûn are
shut in there, and they say the English consul is judging
them in place of our rightful Câdi. Ah, those
Franks are devils. There is no end to their enormities.
And our lords, who suffer them, are little
better.”</p>

<p>Zeyd stayed to hear no more. He ran on, panting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
with misty eyes. Upon the fastened door of the
courthouse a crowd pressed, enjoying a grievous outcry
from within.</p>

<p>“Ha, they beat the malefactors. That is good,”
said a Nazarene to his neighbor. “He knows his
business, this English consul.”</p>

<p>Zeyd thundered in vain at the door. None
opened, and the crowd jeered at him. With heart
near to breaking, he gave up the attempt and ran
headlong toward the Haràm. A great pulse throbbed
in his brain, seeming the pulse of the whole world,
for every object of his gaze beat with it.</p>

<p>The aged Mahmûd Ali, Chief of the Learned in
the Holy City, was coming out of the Mosque El
Aksa on the arm of a young disciple—his senile blindness
doubled for the moment by the sudden sunlight
dropped on him like a dazzling veil—when Zeyd, the
son of Abbâs, fell groveling at his feet.</p>

<p>“Who is it, O my son?” quavered the sheykh,
much alarmed; for he could not discern the form of
the suppliant whether of man or beast.</p>

<p>“It is some mad derwìsh,” replied the lad supporting
him.</p>

<p>“Nay, it is I, Zeyd, the servant of the Sheykh
Shems-ud-dìn. Mad am I now, and with reason, for
they kill my master.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>“O Allah, is it possible? Expound the matter,
O most faithful of servants.”</p>

<p>The old man heard the story sadly to an end.
Then he bade his disciple lead him beneath some trees
which grew by the place of washing. There, in the
shade, he sat down and, taking an inkhorn, a reed, and
a leaf from his girdle, wrote hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Here is a word from me to the Câdi,” he said
to Zeyd. “This is not the first time I have had to
rebuke the slaves of this Mutesarrif. They plead,
and with a measure of justice, that it is hard for few
to govern many without indulging the majority.
None the less it is iniquitous. I here threaten him
with the curse of El Islâm. I adjure him by his
father’s grave. His father was a good old man, a
friend to me. If he remember not his father, then is
he rightly accursed.”</p>

<p>Armed with that writing, Zeyd sped across the
honored pavement to where his slippers lay beside the
steps; and thence to the Mehkemeh, where he arrived
bathed in sweat, and mouthing oddly—a maniac to
all appearance. The crowd, now much diminished,
withdrew from him in alarm. His knocks on the
massive door reverberated as though the hall within
had been as empty as it was silent.</p>

<p>“Open, O sons of Eblìs. In the name of Allah.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
In the name of El Islâm, open, or it shall be the worse
for you.” Zeyd knew not what he cried. He had
forgotten dignities. What mattered anything? It
was the Last Day.</p>

<p>At that high call, the door was opened a little.
Its keepers, expecting to behold some functionary,
gaped on the vision of a sweat-blind vagrant. By
allowance of their stupor the wretch shot past them
into the court.</p>

<p>“Who is this? What means this?” cried a voice
of anger. Zeyd was aware confusedly of men innumerable
rising from the ground with shouts and harsh
laughter. In that peopled dimness he faltered, dazed
and abashed. He heard the voice of the enemy, the
voice of Hassan Agha, calling:</p>

<p>“Behold the grace of Allah. It is he, the murderer,
the rightful victim, brought to us by a miracle.
O Excellency, slay that wicked man and spare us.”</p>

<p>Then, of a sudden, he espied the Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn,
and it was as if a light shone upon him suddenly.
With a glad cry he was going toward his
master when strong arms seized and carried him,
kicking, before the judge.</p>

<p>“Praise be to Allah! We have here the culprit—not
a doubt of it. We will soon extract his confession,”
sighed Yûsuf Effendi, with immense relief.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

</div>

<p>“No; I say no. Allah forbid so great a sin. He
is a good poor man, who never wronged anyone, my
friend these many days. For my sake came he to this
city, mistress of wickedness; and if he have sinned
herein, the blame is mine. Let me die and save him.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn stood between Yûsuf Effendi and
the helpless Zeyd, confronting the former in a posture
not of suppliance. The Câdi frowned, while his eyes
shifted nervously from side to side, then settled on his
string of beads.</p>

<p>“Art possessed, old man?” he remonstrated, in
a whisper. “Seest thou not it is thy chance to escape?
Some one must die. Let it be this dog, who is certainly
not good. It is impossible thou canst know
him, call him friend. Look once more on him, I entreat
thee, what a vile face is there! Thou wast deceived
at the first, the hall is dim. It is not thy friend,
but a villain undeserving of compassion. Let him
take his wages.”</p>

<p>“If he dies, I die with him. He is my friend,
my faithful follower. See, he holds a paper crumpled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
in his hand. It may be a writing of importance to us.
Let it be read, O Excellency. Doubtless it shall explain
his presence here.”</p>

<p>“So be it; but we waste time,” said the Câdi fretfully.
“I grudge every minute lest by ill-hap that
Nazarene should return and end my power to befriend
you.”</p>

<p>A soldier disengaged the paper from Zeyd’s
hand, and passed it to the judge with a reverence.
Yûsuf Effendi read it and turned to stone. His eyes
bolted from their sockets. Then he made the gesture
of throwing dust on his head, of rending his clothes,
and bemoaned the day he was born.</p>

<p>“O Allah, what can be done? O Allah, pity me.
Let the man go, you soldiers. It is an envoy from
the illustrious Mahmûd Ali. O Lord of mercy, what
shall I do, whom slay? O Almighty, appoint me
some victim quickly, for the pig may return who cares
not though I perish, my lord with me. Oh, Allah!
Allah!”</p>

<p>He glanced wildly round him, as though expecting
his prey, new-created, to drop from heaven.
Then he hid his face in his hands and wept before
all men there.</p>

<p>His scribe, with intent to console him, set to work
to make fresh coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>While Yûsuf remained thus, rocked with grief;
while the scribe and a humbler attendant were busy
about the little brazier, and the fragrance of coffee
stewing caused the prisoners and their guards to lick
envious lips, the door of the hall opened once again.
Yûsuf groaned and his face puckered with the peevish
desperation of a child. He supposed it was the Christian
pig, returned to ruin him.</p>

<p>“Take, read, O Yûsuf,” cried a voice of triumph;
when, looking up in surprise, the judge beheld Abd-ur-Rahman
Bey. Still sobbing, he received a flimsy
slip of paper, only to return it with a moan:</p>

<p>“It is in Frankish character, I cannot read it.”</p>

<p>“If my lord the Bey will deign to pass it to
me, with the Câdi’s leave, I can perhaps decipher it,”
said the scribe, once more at his post.</p>

<p>The scribe read, and recognized the words for
Arabic. He quickly transliterated, and handed his
copy to the judge.</p>

<p>“Ma sh’ Allah! O Allah, mercy! Have compassion!
In what have I sinned that such woes are
stacked upon me? I am robbed, and may not take
vengeance; I give judgment, and must reverse my
judgment. And all that is not enough. I myself am
doomed to ruin by the Grand Wazìr. On one hand,
the Grand Wazìr; on the other, the Powers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
Europe. What am I to do, whom obey? Some one
must die or I am ruined. Yet all these must go free,
or I die. What matter in the end? Let me die, since
it is so decreed.”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, O my dear Yûsuf,” whispered
Abd-ur-Rahman at his ear. “Thy plight is by no
means desperate. I see many in this court who are
nothing to my uncle—inquisitives of the city who have
pushed in somehow. Punish a few of them and all
is said.”</p>

<p>“But ... O Lord!... is it not the hour of
sunset? And the consul enjoined, ‘ere sunset.’”</p>

<p>“Take comfort. There is yet half an hour. Let
me indicate the men to thee. Those four by the door
will do. They serve no purpose in the world. I have
seen them often in the streets, and know their kind.
Act at once and secretly. Let not my father guess thy
purpose. Nay, on second thoughts, what need to act
at all in person? I myself will bid the soldiers hale
them forth to execution; and do thou meanwhile make
thy peace with my father and all these his companions.”</p>

<p>“May Allah reward thee, O child of my soul.
Thy wit has saved my honor.” In the fullness of his
heart the judge embraced Abd-ur-Rahman, and
kissed him on both cheeks. “One other favor I must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
beg of thee: let some one seek out the chancellor of
the English consulate, that he may see the corpses.
Bid him ask if it is the consul’s desire that their heads
be severed and set up in some public place for an
example to other malefactors.”</p>

<p>No sooner had Abd-ur-Rahman left his side than
the Câdi stepped down off the dais. Approaching
the Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn, he strove to kiss his hand,
craving pardon for the indignities heaped in error on
one so illustrious. His urbanity fully restored, he
talked and joked lightly with the prisoners, calling
them his children, his soul’s dear ones, smiling lovingly
upon each and all of them, even upon his two
robbers. Loud swelled their praise of his magnanimity,
and many were the coins thrust into the hand
which he held for convenience’ sake behind his back.
The Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn blessed him, and made him
a present on account of Zeyd. With pious eyes, Yûsuf
Effendi thanked God for his mercies, and repeatedly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“O lucky day!”</p>

<p>At length Abd-ur-Rahman came back to him and
whispered:</p>

<p>“It is finished.”</p>

<p>“The praise to Allah. You are released, all of
you; your arms are restored,” cried the Câdi, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
bounteous gestures. “Sin no more, I beseech you;
but go your ways in peace.”</p>

<p>“In this hour we shall set out for our own place,”
said Hassan Agha, when the storm of blessings had
subsided. He with Shibli took a penitent leave of the
Sheykh Shems-ud-dìn, who would not be prevailed on
to accompany them.</p>

<p>The court then emptied apace.</p>

<p>Yûsuf bowed low before Shems-ud-dìn, who, attended
by Mâs and Zeyd, yet lingered in the darkening
hall. He besought him:</p>

<p>“Deign, O my lord, to write a little—a mere word—to
the brother of thy Grace, to the august Milhem
Pasha, Pillar of the Throne, that he may know I have
done his bidding against all opponents. Write, I
pray thee, that I would do aught imaginable to oblige
his noble Excellency, that I am the humblest of his
servants, that I kiss the earth between his two feet....
O Nâsr, bring paper, ink, and a sound reed,
hither to our lord. Deign to sit down. Ennoble my
name, which is Yûsuf Effendi, son to Muhammed
Effendi, who was formerly Mûfti in this city. May
Allah Most High reward the affability of your
Mighty Reverence. My house is thy house. Truly,
now is my soul between thy two hands.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn wrote as requested, and handed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
paper to the judge, who passed it on to the scribe, who
made a letter of it ready for transmission through
the post.</p>

<p>Abd-ur-Rahman stood afar off by the wall, lurking
in the background, a shadow among shadows.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

</div>

<p>Outside the hall of judgment it was dusk in the
streets. Men wending homeward from the place of
business hurried past, a dwindling stream. Their lanterns,
shining with confined rays, appeared set in the
first rich bloom of night like the eyes in a peacock’s
tail. Shems-ud-dìn desired no lantern to guide his
steps. The dogs beginning to prowl after offal might
snarl at his disturbance, he feared not their spite; he
cared for nothing earthly. Through a gap in the
hard black roofs, the flowers of heaven shone in their
pleasant field. He did not observe them, all desire
of the eyes, all lust of contemplation having rest
within him.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, in a quiet place, Zeyd plucked
his robe.</p>

<p>“Haste, O my master; the soldiers follow us!”</p>

<p>“Hist!” whispered Mâs from the background.
“Be silent, blockhead! It is his son who follows.”</p>

<p>Zeyd and Mâs together shrank away into the
darkness.</p>

<p>Confused by the touch of Zeyd, by words which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
had failed to pierce his sad abstraction, and yet more
by the vanishing of the disturbers ere he could ask
what ailed them, Shems-ud-dìn stood still, as they had
left him, looking back.</p>

<p>A tall shape grew out of the darkness. It loomed
swiftly upon him. He heard a sobbing, felt his robe
caught fast in a clutch of despair.</p>

<p>“Forsake me not, O my father!”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Abd-ur-Rahman, the one voice
in all the world of power to strike him. Folding his
son to his breast, the old man lifted up his voice
and wept.</p>

<p>“Ah, have mercy, O my father! Go not now to
the khan, but turn aside into this entry till I bare my
soul to thee.”</p>

<p>“Is it worth the while, O beloved? Do I not
know already?” said Shems-ud-dìn; but his son’s will
constrained him.</p>

<p>In a gloom so profound that the night they had
left without seemed a brightness by comparison, Abd-ur-Rahman
fell at his father’s feet. When the sheykh
strove to raise him, he uttered cries of pain.</p>

<p>“Let be, O my father! First hear me to an end.
When I left thee to go to my uncle, I was the child
of thy training; I knew no law but that God sent,
in which thou hadst instructed me; I thought that all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
who call themselves Muslimûn deferred to that law
in conscience as in form. But when I came to Istanbûl,
and beheld the grandeur of that city, with its
wealth and luxury, my soul doubted, and I looked two
ways; for things I had reckoned sinful were there
done openly in the daylight, while men of ripe years
and superior judgment smiled at my careful observances
and scruples against the use of this and that.
After a little, thy likeness faded from my remembrance;
thy maxims sounded faint amid the voices
near me.</p>

<p>“The precepts of my uncle Milhem were not
what thine had been. He is a good man in his fashion,
and was very kind to me. His wisdom, his wit
in talk, compelled my admiration. The high authority
I saw him wield enforced respect. Moreover,
having no son of his own body, he used me as the
apple of his eye. He gave me money for my pleasures,
more than I had ever seen in all my life. He
chose for me companions, Turks, the sons of good
houses, in whose society I ate and drank of abomination.”</p>

<p>Here a burst of sobbing broke the narrative.
Abd-ur-Rahman had felt his father’s hand touch
his brow.</p>

<p>“Yet for that my uncle was not angry. He only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
laughed, when I confessed to him, and bade me have
a care for my health. He himself was my tutor in
the science of statecraft, of which he is the greatest
master. From him I learnt to separate faith and behavior,
the rules of government and those from Allah
Most High. He placed me for a while at the customhouse,
and when I had there learnt all that he
wished me to learn from the conduct of the officials,
he brought me into the employment of a certain wazìr,
his friend. Everywhere I saw the needy turned away,
while he who owned fine clothes and brought a gift
in his hand secured an audience. Hence I contracted
a loathing for the poor and miserable, and would
never be seen in the company of a man ill-clad.</p>

<p>“From the closet of that wazìr I passed to the
military service, in which I served but two months
before the influence of my uncle procured my appointment
to this garrison as a yezbashi. At the same
time I received from the bounty of our Sultàn the
style and dignity of Bey.</p>

<p>“In the parting audience my uncle informed me
that he would no longer push my fortunes so openly,
for fear of jealousies, but that I must make my own
way on from the start he had given me. He would
make me an allowance of money, which he named
and I thought most handsome. Then came his last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
word of advice. It was to associate only with those
who could further my career. He said, laughing,
that he was afraid lest my father’s son should waste
time in the profitless frequentation of learned madmen,
in relieving the wants of scabby beggars, who
said never ‘The Lord reward thee.’ He need not
have thus adjured me, for already I was the son of
his teaching.</p>

<p>“So it came to pass, O my father, that when I
came to this city, and found myself a personage
courted and admired, I forbore to think on the little
place of my birth, or on the friends of my youth, but
made all my endeavor to appear the greatest possible,
vaunting my high lineage and powerful connections.
I sent no word unto thee, O my father, nor let anyone
suspect thy presence upon earth. I even told a comrade,
who inquired of me somewhat straitly, that I
was an orphan, and that my father had been a great
statesman on the pattern of my uncle Milhem.”</p>

<p>A deep groan from the mouth of the passage
caused Abd-ur-Rahman to cease speaking and start
to his feet.</p>

<p>“Some one listens. May his house be destroyed!”</p>

<p>“Who is out there?” called Shems-ud-dìn; and
the voice of Zeyd made answer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>“It is I, O my master, and with me Mâs the
black.”</p>

<p>“O insolence! May their fathers perish!” cried
Abd-ur-Rahman.</p>

<p>“Nay, curse them not, my son. They are folk
of our own house. In my distress, when thou and
Shibli and all others left me, this Zeyd was hands and
feet and ears and eyes to me. Mâs thou knowest of
old; I have no need to tell thee who he is. Continue,
O my soul!”</p>

<p>“When I received the letter warning of thy coming,
which reached me in the same hour when thou
shouldst arrive, I knew not what countenance to
adopt. Indeed my surprise was great, for I had not
written to thee, and who, I wondered, could have informed
thee of my existence in El Cûds? One half
of me yearned for thy blessing, while the other hung
back for fear lest by thy means some of my pretensions
should be belied.</p>

<p>“When I beheld thee riding in so strange-looking
a company, when I found thee resolute to pursue
thy dealings with the Frank physician, I determined
thenceforth to visit thee only in secret, and to refute
every rumor of our relationship which might get
abroad. Thanks to the garrulity of Hassan Agha, I
was driven thrice to contradict that kind of rumor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p>The narrator paused, sobbing. Again a hollow
groan from the mouth of the tunnel made him wince.
But he soon recovered enough force to proceed in a
broken voice:</p>

<p>“O my father, what is left to tell? Thou knowest
the end of the story, how the shock of thy captivity
drove out the devil which had so long possessed
me; how I strove, tardily, to repair my fault. Now
see, I am the dust before thee. My companions, for
whose sake I sinned, now turn from me with sneers
and cutting taunts. I am become unclean in their
sight.</p>

<p>“And now, O my father, learn my firm resolve.
I will at once resign my high position and the favor
of my uncle, and return with thee to our little town
in the wilds, there to end my days in thy peace and in
the way of the upright.”</p>

<p>“God is Most Great! God is Most Merciful!
Unto God the praise!” cried Mâs and Zeyd together
from the night without.</p>

<p>“I approve not at all,” said Shems-ud-dìn gently,
yet with decision, “unless on one condition: that
thou remain first a full three months at thy post. If,
when that term shall have expired, thy desire be not
altered, then come to us; and may Allah grant thee
of His blessings!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>“But ... O Lord!” moaned Abd-ur-Rahman,
in anguish. “My companions—all my acquaintance
spurn me. How can I endure for three months the
scorn of all around me?”</p>

<p>“The scorn will not long survive its cause. And
if some things I have heard are true, thou art not all
contemptible, my son. Thou art called a zealous, a
competent, and a clever officer; and, moreover, I hear
it said that thou alone of all thy kind hast been known
to refuse a bribe.”</p>

<p>“The praise in that is not mine. It belongs,
under Allah, to my uncle Milhem, who keeps me so
well provided that I require not the gifts of any man.
But, O my father! ask me not to endure for three
months the sneer of my companions.”</p>

<p>“I ask no less, my son. Be brave, O beloved!
Consent to reap the harvest of thy sin; so shall it be
expiated before Allah, whose wrath is more to be
feared than my pain or the looks of thy companions.
To-morrow thou wilt present me to the Mutesarrif,
to the Chief of the Soldiers, and to all thy friends;
and I shall contrive to let fall a word or two to lighten
thy offense. Fear not that I shall bring shame or ridicule
upon thee. My speech is not that of the fellâh
or the muleteer. Afterwards I, in my turn, will present
thee to the Chief of the Learned, whose blessing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
shall sustain thee through the trial. Thy mistake has
been always to shun the society of the devout and
studious. It is the mistake of my brother Milhem....
Now walk with me to the khan.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I beseech thee! I have wept much; I
would avoid the stare of strangers.”</p>

<p>“I say not, enter with me; but bear me company
as far as to the door.”</p>

<p>The street seemed light as they came forth to it.
Great stars throbbed overhead in a tranquil sky, but
the grudging house shapes and frequent arches allowed
but a glimpse of them. Mâs stalked in front
and Zeyd behind, to kick off the dogs which soon
formed a barking phalanx in their wake. Shems-ud-dìn
held his son’s hand in a tight clasp. At the entrance
of the khan, he embraced him and let him go.</p>

<p>Then, having watched him depart, he caused
Mâs to fetch a lantern and light him up a dark and
broken stair to the roof of the hostelry, whence he
could view the perfect flower of night and drink its
fragrance.</p>

<p>The city slept around him. Except for light here
and there in some upper chamber, for the shapen
Dome of the Rock and a few minarets, he might have
thought it an outcrop of black rock on the face of the
hills. Far away to the eastward, across a gulf, appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
the rampart of his own land, vague and
dreamy beneath the stars.</p>

<p>Peace fell about him like a pleasant rain. To-morrow
he would go hand in hand with his long-lost
son. To-morrow, for the last time, he would visit
the grave of Alia. To-morrow, ere the sunset, he
would take leave of the wicked city never to return.
If Allah willed.</p>

<p>Alia was dead, his blindness gone. Once more
he could see clearly the right way. Once more he
enjoyed access to the mercy of the Most High.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

</div>

<p>The year’s last rain had fallen and the power of
the summer sun was fresh on all the land. With
thanks to Allah, the little party of travelers approached
the region of great trees in the highland beyond
Es-Salt. Mâs, walking beside the litter which
contained Fatmeh, wiped his face with his hand repeatedly
and shook off the drops thus reaped upon the
ground.</p>

<p>“It is hot, O mother of stale delights,” he observed
friendly. “How fares it with thee inside
there?”</p>

<p>“I stifle—I expire,” moaned Fatmeh.</p>

<p>“Take heart, O waning moon! The shade is
at hand. Already I can see one bûtm tree—a
black head like mine above the hill. But shade
is the parent of flies, winged devils. Mules stung
by them wax restless. Thy charms will be sorely
shaken.”</p>

<p>“O Lord, have mercy! Am I not dead already?”</p>

<p>Mâs grinned and brought his goad to bear upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
the leading mule, which had stopped in a vain endeavor
to bite its flank.</p>

<p>They were engaged in climbing the brow of a
ridge by a path embarrassed with loose stones and
occasional smooth rocks, treacherous to the hoofs.
Shems-ud-dìn led the way upon his old white horse,
whose tail kept swishing. He was followed by Zeyd,
the son of Abbâs, a deplorable figure surmounting
the last of asses. At the crown of the ascent
the sheykh drew rein, allowing Zeyd to come up
beside him.</p>

<p>“Praise to Allah!” he exclaimed, with hand
shading his eyes.</p>

<p>Before them upon the sun-bleached slopes grew
many trees, of dark foliage which looked rusty as
compared with its own rich shadow.</p>

<p>“Praise to Allah!” echoed Zeyd, and therewith
groaned, for the hour of parting was come.</p>

<p>At the foremost knot of trees a halt was made;
the litter was set down, and the beasts took their ease
in battle with the flies. Fatmeh stepped forth from
her prison, strictly veiled, and sat down on the farther
side of the trunks from that where her lord
reclined. Zeyd lay down before the sheykh and
ground his forehead in the mast from those trees.
He wept:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>“O dear lord! All my life shall I thank Allah
for the memory of thee. Hereafter, when thou art
dead and thy remains are covered with a white tomb,
a wely where good men pause to pray, Zeyd will be
thy pilgrim yearly. Now, after an hour or two, if
God will, I shall see again my own house, my woman,
and all belonging to me. By means of this ass, which
the owner would not receive again, I travel comfortably.
My soul will rejoice in the home-coming. Yet
shall I never forget thee, O my guide. Till the Last
Day I am the better for thee. May Allah reward
thee for thy mercy toward me—thou high and
learned, I the meanest in the land.”</p>

<p>“O kindest, O best, O most patient of all men
living,” cried Shems-ud-dìn, striving to raise him.</p>

<p>But Zeyd clove to the dust, praying:</p>

<p>“Bless me, O light from Allah, before I go. A
long, a learned blessing, O my master.”</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn blessed him then at great length.
Knowing the weakness of his poor disciple, he used
to indulge it words of poetical and learned use which,
for Zeyd, fell straight from heaven.</p>

<p>“O my eyes! O too great glory! O my soul,”
gasped the fellâh, moaning and wriggling in the
depth of enjoyment.</p>

<p>At the close of the benediction, Mâs, who stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
beating off flies from the horse of Shems-ud-dìn,
cried:</p>

<p>“O Zeyd, thou art blest indeed. I behold that
blessing upon thee, a robe of purple embroidered with
gold and jewelry. Henceforth thou art not like the
rest of us.”</p>

<p>Sobbing, speechless for beatitude, Zeyd struggled
to his knees. He seized the sheykh’s hand and, carrying
it to his lips, rained passionate kisses upon it.
Then, starting up, he ran to his donkey, bestrode the
same, and, plying his stick, shambled off through the
grove.</p>

<p>Shems-ud-dìn, as he watched Zeyd’s form recede,
now blooming in a sun ray, now fading in dense
shadow, was not distressed. Time was when he
would have sorrowed thus to part with the kindest
of creatures. But now he saw men only as the sun
sees them, while loving them for the love of God who
made them.</p>

<p>Attendant on the beasts, Mâs had wandered to
a farther group of trees, beneath which was some
growth of herbage.</p>

<p>Over Shems-ud-dìn’s head the peep of sky through
the branches made separate sapphires set in ebonwork.
His eyes uplifted in dreamy contemplation, he did
not see Fatmeh creeping toward him round the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
tree trunk. Only when she took his hand and
pressed it to her forehead did he wake to her presence
with him.</p>

<p>“What ails thee, woman?” he asked in dismay.</p>

<p>“O hard of heart! O cruel!” she whimpered.
“Art thou not lord of me? Has my fancy ever
strayed from thy goodliness to desire another’s?
Now Alia is dead, what am I? The women at the
spring will mock me, saying, ‘O thing despised, alone
in his house, yet unembraced.’ O my dear lord, O
tree of sweet fruit shading me, could I tell when I
joined thy harìm, to wait upon thy daughter, that by
so doing I should render my widowhood eternal? I
knew thou hadst no other, save me and that very old
one who is since dead.... Let not the offense which
I committed at that other tree stand ever in thy sight
against me. May Allah blast that other till the Last
Day. Died not my soul beneath its branches? But
this is a good tree, of shade most pleasant. Ah, put
me not away, O lord of justice.”</p>

<p>Slowly the import of her blubbering reached
Shems-ud-dìn’s intelligence; and he saw plainly how,
immersed in selfish grief, he had dealt harshly by his
servant. Her desires were natural and legitimate.
She was now alone in his house. He sought no other
woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>“So be it,” he said. “Very kind hast thou been
to me through this time of trouble. When the days
of my grief are accomplished, if Allah spares us, thou
shalt have thy will.”</p>

<p>The creature’s gladness seemed excessive to one
for whom all things were now equal under heaven.</p>

<p class="tb">In the wide archway of his own house, overlooking
the small white city which had been his care so
many years, the minaret which he had caused to be
built, and the yellow hills rolling to violet in the distance,
Shems-ud-dìn sat on a morning and wrote to
his brother Milhem. Behind him, in the shadow,
knelt Mâs employed in trimming the lamps of the
house, shaking one after another to be sure it had oil
enough. The sheykh paused often before recharging
his reed to gaze out over the sun-baked land and smile,
part ruefully.</p>

<p>“After inquiry touching thy illustrious health, I
submit to thee, O my dear brother, that my son Abd-ur-Rahman
does, upon mature reflection, elect to retire
to a private station and has returned to this little
city, to the house of me his father; that he entreats
thy pardon for a defection which must bear the look
of ingratitude; but that, in excuse, he has not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
strength of thee, O my brother, to escape corruption
in a path so full of temptations. Forget not, O my
dear, how his childhood was spent in a quiet place,
among simple folk, far from all those seductions
which spring from too much luxury and the intercourse
with foreigners and men unsteadfast in the
faith.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding, I will not hide from thee my
own lively pleasure in this end to his deliberations,
which appears to me the right one in the sight of
Allah.</p>

<p>“Furthermore, let me thank thee once again for
thy gracious intervention when Allah willed that I
should be accused falsely in El Cûds, whither I went
last spring, on an evil prompting, to subject my beloved
daughter, then very ill, to the treatment of a
Frank physician, in whose house she died very peacefully,
the praise to Allah. Though sad for the loss
of my daughter, and more for the inordinate affection
my soul bore her, which conscience tells was the
cause of that loss, I am not unhappy. Thanks to
Allah! Here I am surrounded by friends who wish
me well. A woman, long a servant in my house and
attendant on my little Alia, now tends to the comfort
of my age, and lavishes on me the endearments for
which her sort were created. Hassan Agha, our old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
acquaintance, was felled from his horse and wounded
recently in a conflict with certain of the Bedû who,
harboring a grudge against him for some wrong he
did to them in El Cûds, have harried us these three
months past—against all precedent, for their time of
sojourn here is the winter—but now seem gone from
the land, for which we praise Allah. As for Hassan,
thy bounteous grant of rifles and powder has done
much to reconcile him to my son, with whom he quarreled
in El Cûds. All my neighbors, alike Arab and
Circassian, honored my son with a great reception on
his arrival yesterday in the morning.</p>

<p>“And now, O my brother, once more I beseech
thee to forgive thy brother and the son of thy brother,
who are both very sensible of meriting thy most just
displeasure. And May Allah preserve thee always.”</p>

<p>This letter, when folded and sealed, was intrusted
to the soldier servant of Abd-ur-Rahman,
who was obliged to set out that day on his return
to El Cûds.</p>

<p>In less than a month it was answered. A
trooper from the garrison of Esh-Shâm, calling God
and his horse to witness that he had ridden day and
night without a halt, delivered the missive to Shems-ud-dìn
as he sat in the entry of his house toward sunset.
With the usual courtesies, it ran:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>“I have received thy honored letter, and though
I grieve much for the loss of a youth whom I had
come to regard as my son (a thing I could never procure
of my own body, though I have tried many
women and begotten at divers times no less than sixteen
daughters, if I count aright, so that I have come
to hate girl children as a deception, and utterly fail to
comprehend thy infatuation for that girl who died),
yet I will not disguise from thee that the withdrawal
of the young one has done me good in my position.
It is but policy in the sovereign to look askance on
the posterity of men of note; and that custom of the
Turks is wise by which honors descend not from
father to son. The eyes of many in high places regarded
with disfavor my fondness for Abd-ur-Rahman;
but now, an old man without a sequel, I arouse
no hatred, only expectations. What am I, thus
lonely, but a kind of eunuch, a natural and unenviable
appanage of sovereignty.</p>

<p>“I rejoice to learn in what love and esteem thou
art held by all who know thee. As for me, I am beset
with fears and hostile ambitions. Never in my life
have I inspired sincere affection, save only in thee, O
my brother. By Allah, the image of your little town
rises tempting now in my mind, though in the days
I was condemned to sojourn there I deemed it Jehennûm.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
It is because of our love, O my brother, for
the sake of our parting there at daybreak among the
rocks, that the thought of it now allures me. I am
old and thou art old, but if it is the will of Allah that
I fall some day from use, as may well betide—should
my life then be spared and exile satisfy the lust of
my enemies—I shall choose for place of banishment
thy little town beneath the hill of ruins, and count it
bliss to end my days at peace in the house of my
brother.”</p>

<p>When Shems-ud-dìn looked up from the writing,
he was blind with crowded visions of a bygone day.
Out of the evening calm he looked and saw the vanity
of man’s endeavor, from least to greatest, upon the
earth, and how it floats on God’s mercy as a boat on
the mighty deep. And he cried from his soul:</p>

<p>“Allah is greatest!”</p>

<p>“The Great Refusal” is the refusal of the son,
a man of mind, to continue in the career mapped

<p>“When Maxwell Gray gave to the world the celebrated
novel ‘The Silence of Dean Maitland,’ critics wondered
if such a gifted writer would one day strike a purer, clearer
note. She has just done so in issuing ‘The Great Refusal,’
a novel of self-sacrifice. No more uplifting book
of its kind has appeared since Besant’s ‘All Sorts and

of “Mills of God.” Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>“With very much the grace and charm of Robert Louis
Stevenson, the author of ‘The Life of Nancy Stair’ combines
unusual gifts of narrative, characterization, color, and
humor. She has also delicacy, dramatic quality, and that
rare gift—historic imagination.</p>

<p>“‘The Life of Nancy Stair’ is interesting from the first
sentence to the last; the characters are vital and are, also,
most entertaining company; the denouement unexpected
and picturesque and cleverly led up to from one of the
earliest chapters; the story moves swiftly and without a
hitch. Robert Burns is neither idealized nor caricatured;
Sandy, Jock, Pitcairn, Danvers Carmichael, and the Duke
of Borthewicke are admirably relieved against each other,
and Nancy herself as irresistible as she is natural. To be
sure, she is a wonderful child, but then she manages to
make you believe she was a real one. Indeed, reality and
naturalness are two of the charms of a story that both
reaches the heart and engages the mind, and which can
scarcely fail to make for itself a large audience. A great
deal of delightful talk and interesting incidents are used for
the development of the story. Whoever reads it will advise
everybody he knows to read it; and those who do not care
for its literary quality cannot escape the interest of a love-story
full of incident and atmosphere.”</p>

the sun-kissed mountain peaks are above the hum-drum valleys.”—<i>St.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
